Efficaces pour degager les structures globales, ces representations sont parfois peu exploitables des lors que l'on s'interesse a une perspective du graphe a partir de certains sommets privilegies. Or l'information recherchee a souvent un caractere local . Pour representer le graphe du point de vue d'un ou de plusieurs sommets selectionnes, nous proposons une methode d'Analyse en Composantes Principales Granulaire consistant a appliquer une A.C.P. filtree a un tableau de proximites.

66877890,23002,Tasks for Temporal Graph Visualisation,2014-02-10,7,1,,2597013281,2014,arXiv: Other Computer Science,"Natalie Kerracher, Jessie Kennedy, Kevin Chalmers","In [1], we describe the design and development of a task taxonomy for temporal graph visualisation. This paper details the full instantiation of that task taxonomy. Our task taxonomy is based on the Andrienko framework [2], which uses a systematic approach to develop a formal task framework for visual tasks specifically associated with Exploratory Data Analysis. The Andrienko framework is intended to be applicable to all types of data, however, it does not consider relational (graph) data. We therefore extended both their data model and task framework for temporal graph data, and instantiated the extended version to produce a comprehensive list of tasks of interest during exploratory analysis of temporal graph data. As expected, our instantiation of the framework resulted in a very large task list; with more than 144 variations of attribute based tasks alone, it is too large to fit in a standard journal paper, hence we provide the detailed listing in this document."

Casanova, Stefan Dietze","A key challenge of the Semantic Web lies in the creation of semantic links between Web resources. The creation of links serves as a mean to semantically enrich Web resources, connecting disparate information sources and facilitating data reuse and sharing. As the amount of data on the Web is ever increasing, automated methods to unveil links between Web resources are required. In this paper, we introduce a tool, called SCS Connector, that assists users to uncover links between entity pairs within and across datasets. SCS Connector provides a Web-based user interface and a RESTful API that enable users to interactively visualise and analyse paths between an entity pair ((e_i,e_j)) through known links that can reveal meaningful relationships between ((e_i,e_j)) according to a semantic connectivity score ((SCS))."

Passmore, Dong-Han Ham","It seems that straight lines seldom occur in natural objects and that humans actually prefer curved lines [1]. Thus it may not seem surprising that in aesthetics, curved lines are often to be preferred over straight ones, as found for example in Hogarth's serpentine Line of Beauty [2]. More recently a number of confluent drawings [3] and edge bundling [4] methods have been proposed to reduce edge clutter by using curved edges. Inspired by the work of Mark Lombardi, there is also theoretical work [5] that uses curved edges to optimises angular resolution, i.e., keep the angles between adjacent edge uniform."

This article first reviews the advances made in the field of graph drawing that have then often been applied by the information visualisation community. There then follows a discussion of a range of techniques developed specifically for graph visualisations. Graph drawing algorithms are categorised into the followings approaches: force- directed layouts, the use of dimension reduction in graph layout and computational improvements including multi-level techniques. While methods developed specifically for graph visualisation often make use of node-attributes by using them as constraints or for explicit representations in 2D space. The similarities and distinctions between these techniques are examined and the aim is to provide a detailed assessment of currently available graph layout techniques, specifically how they can be used by visualisation practitioners and to motivate further research in the area."

Research approach -- We propose the design of a graph visualisation for studying communicating around shared task foci in collaborative editing of Wikipedia. Findings/Design -- Task foci of edits and interpersonal relations between participants shape a unified task structure that can be used to study subtasks that give rise to collaborative discussion, within the global collective process. Research limitations/Implications -- Our analysis is restricted to the editing process of a single article. Originality/Value -- We propose visualisation techniques of collective online activity using combinations of relations between task and discussion spaces. Take away message -- Online collective epistemic activity comprises alternation between decoupled action and zones of close collaboration between specific specialised participants, in relation to specific subtasks bearing on fundamental issues. This can be visualised across task and discussion spaces using specific techniques."

We discuss the process involved in their generation, and describe how the design space can be xe2x80x98sliced and dicedxe2x80x99 into multiple overlapping task categories, requiring distinct visual techniques for their support. The approach addresses deficiencies in the task literature, offering domain independence, greater task coverage, and unambiguous task specification. The taxonomy and design space capture tasks for temporal graphs, and also static graphs, multivariate graphs, and graph comparison, and will be of value in the design and evaluation of temporal graph visualisation systems."
2146308472,20404,A comparison of set-based and graph-based visualisations of overlapping classification hierarchies,2000-05-01,26,41,1134066369,,2000,Advanced Visual Interfaces (AVI),"Martin Graham, Jessie Kennedy, Chris Hand","The visualisation of hierarchical information sets has been a staple of Information Visualisation since the field came into being in the early 1990's. However, at present, support for visualising the correlations between multiple, overlapping sets of hierarchical information has been lacking. This is despite the realisation that for certain tasks this information is as important as the information that forms the individual hierarchies. In response to this, we have produced two early visualisation prototypes, one based on a graph visualisation, and the other on a set-based metaphor, that endeavour to display such information in a readily perceived form to potential users. The science of botanical taxonomy is used as an example of a field where such a visualisation would be useful, and also as a resource for example information sets that the prototypes can act upon. Technical and perceptual issues involved in the design and implementation of both prototypes are discussed. Following this, informal user testing on both prototypes is described, which utilised user observation techniques to elicit qualitative feedback from the taxonomists. These findings are then used to emphasise the shortcomings and advantages of each prototype, and from these probable issues for future prototyping and development are drawn."

We identify two independent dimensions upon which the techniques can be classified: graph structural encoding and temporal encoding. Based on these dimensions, we create a matrix into which we organise existing techniques. We identify gaps in this design space which may prove interesting opportunities for the development of novel techniques. We also consider additional dimensions on which further useful classification could be made. In organising the disparate existing approaches from a wide range of domains, our classification will assist those new to the research area, and designers and evaluators developing systems for temporal graph data by raising awareness of the range of possible approaches available, and highlighting possible directions for further research."

We then show how existing techniques, such as graph simplification, enriched visualisation algorithms and interactive features, can be usefully combined to aid users in gaining insights. We implement our techniques as a Drupal module, and demonstrate the utility of InfoVis through scenarios of constructing co-authorship network, nanomaterial terms co-occurrence network, NanoParticle Ontology tree and nanomaterial toxicity plot. Our design is supportive for analysts and researchers to identify concepts and relationships in NEI studies."

In order to effectively organise and conduct such exercise, the exercise control team must have accurate situational awareness of the exercise teams. In this paper, the communication patterns collected during a large-scale cyber exercise, and their possible use in improving Situational awareness of exercise control team were analysed. Communication patterns were analysed using graph visualisation and time-series based methods. In addition, suitability of a new reporting tool was analysed. The reporting tool was developed for improving situational awareness and exercise control flow. The tool was used for real-time reporting and communication in various exercise related tasks. Based on the results, it can be stated that the communication patterns can be effectively used to infer performance of exercise teams and improve situational awareness of exercise control team in a complex large-scale cyber security exercise. In addition, the developed model and state-of-the-art reporting tool enable real-time analysis for achieving a better situational awareness for the exercise control of the cyber security exercise."

Voolstra, Christian R. Voolstra, Christian Wild","Eutrophication (i.e. the increase of [in-]organic nutrients) may affect the functioning of coral reefs, but knowledge about the effects on nitrogen (N) cycling and its relationship to productivity within benthic reef communities is scarce. Thus, we investigated how in situ manipulated eutrophication impacted productivity along with 2 counteracting N-cycling pathways (dinitrogen [N 2 ]-fixation, denitrification), using a combined acetylene assay. We hypothesised that N 2 -fixation would decrease and denitrification increase in response to eutrophication. N fluxes and productivity (measured as dark and light oxygen fluxes assessed in incubation experiments) were determined for 3 dominant coral reef functional groups (reef sediments, turf algae, and the scleractinian coral Pocillopora verrucosa ) after 8 wk of in situ nutrient enrichment in the central Red Sea. Using slow-release fertiliser, we increased the dissolved inorganic N concentration by up to 7-fold compared to ambient concentrations. Experimental nutrient enrichment stimulated both N 2 -fixation and denitrification across all functional groups 2- to 7-fold and 2- to 4-fold, respectively. Productivity doubled in reef sediments and remained stable for turf algae and P. verrucosa . Our data therefore suggest that (1) turf algae are major N 2 -fixers in coral reefs, while denitrification is widespread among all investigated groups; (2) surprisingly, and contrary to our hypothesis, both N 2 -fixation and denitrification are involved in the response to moderate N eutrophication, and (3) stimulated N 2 -fixation and denitrification are not directly influenced by productivity.

To this end, we propose a community-based approach to speed up graph drawing for social networks under the assumption that the position of a vertex in the graph is mainly determined by the vertexes which are in the same community with it. Experiments indicate that, comparing with the classical force-direct algorithm, our approach can significantly reduce the running time without the loss of graph readability."

As a result, it is often challenging for a user to understand the relationships in the social networks and make an informed decision over it. Graphs have become a standard for social networks visualization and analysis. However, in this paper, a few visualizations based on a treemap overlaid by a graph with a different number of curves, edges, and nodes were designed and evaluated. As a case study, a Twitter network was visualized, where the treemap overlaid with a graph conveyed information on people in a network, their relationships and common interests. The performance of the treemap visualizations, including the accuracy and time of answering questions was evaluated by twenty three participants in comparison to another well-known visualization based on Euler diagram. Finally, the results of the performance evaluation, limitations and usefulness of the designed visualizations were discussed."

As Web 2.0 has evolved this way, analyzing social networks has become a promising research issue. There have already been several researches on social network analysis based on users' activities in social services. Most of them focus on the links among the users such as citation, trackback, and comment. However, few studies have analyzed the relations within message threads. In general, they considered the one-way relationship from a comment writer to a post writer. Since users communicate with each other primarily by posting comments one after another, the message threads are key to analyzing latent social relationships. In this paper, we propose a novel method to extract the social relations hidden behind message threads. To evaluate our algorithms, we developed an evaluation system and measured the performances. In addition, since the typical node-edge diagram for social network visualization is not intuitive or readable, we also introduce a novel visualization and interaction method suitable for social relation exploration. Further, we expect our work will help enhance social recommendations, advertisements and personalization."

Berger-Wolf","Social network analysis is the study of patterns of interaction between social entities. The field is attracting increasing attention from diverse disciplines including sociology, epidemiology, and behavioral ecology. An important sociological phenomenon that draws the attention of analysts is the emergence of communities, which tend to form, evolve, and dissolve gradually over a period of time. Understanding this evolution is crucial to sociologists and domain scientists, and often leads to a better appreciation of the social system under study. Therefore, it is imperative that social network visualization tools support this task. While graph-based representations are well suited for investigating structural properties of networks at a single point in time, they appear to be significantly less useful when used to analyze gradual structural changes over a period of time. In this paper, we present an interactive visualization methodology for dynamic social networks. Our technique focuses on revealing the community structure implied by the evolving interaction patterns between individuals. We apply our visualization to analyze the community structure in the US House of Representatives. We also report on a user study conducted with the participation of behavioral ecologists working with social network datasets that depict interactions between wild animals. Findings from the user study confirm that the visualization was helpful in providing answers to sociological questions as well as eliciting new observations on the social organization of the population under study."

Since they are managed by individuals, their links tend to mirror or, in some cases, establish new types of social relations, thereby creating a social network. Studying the evolution of this network allows the discovery of emerging social structures and their growth trends. In this paper, we demonstrate the advantages of using the self-organizing maps (SOM) to visualize the evolution of a social network formed by a set of blogs, from their beginning to their current state. By observing the position a weblog is mapped to, it is easy to see what communities it belongs to nowadays, and how and when it became a part of those communities. The proposed procedure gives some insight on how communities are formed and have evolved.

As centrality represents the prestige or importance of a node in a network, its sensitivity represents the importance of the relationship between this and all other nodes in the network. We have derived an analytical solution that extracts the sensitivity as the derivative of centrality with respect to degree for two centrality metrics based on feedback and random walks. We show that these sensitivities are good indicators of the distribution of centrality in the network, and how changes are expected to be propagated if we introduce changes to the network. These metrics also help us simplify a complex network in a way that retains the main structural properties and that results in trustworthy, readable diagrams. Sensitivity is also a key concept for uncertainty analysis of social networks, and we show how our approach may help analysts gain insight on the robustness of key network metrics. Through a number of examples, we illustrate the need for measuring sensitivity, and the impact it has on the visualization of and interaction with social and other scale-free networks."

One interesting way of reducing this clutter is to use partial edges when there are visual elements (edge and curve) crossings. This paper empirically evaluates the use of partial edges for a small-scaled Euler diagrams with graphs and tests whether Euler diagrams with partial edges are readable and interpretable. In this study, twenty participants were presented with eighteen manually drawn diagrams using a software which recorded the answers and the time taken to answer each question. The results indicate that there is no significant difference between diagrams having partial and non-partial edges in terms of accuracy and time (performance analysis) but users preferred partial edges to be aesthetically pleasing in terms of reading graphs in Euler diagrams and layout features (preference analysis), which means partial edges can be used as a strategy to avoid clutter. The results obtained from the task performance and preference will be useful in generating real small-world graphs in an optimal way. The paper concludes that partial edges in a graph does not significantly affect comprehension and as a further direction, our existing Euler diagrams with complete graphs (full edges) tool will be extended to partial edges and evaluated."

Deng","In this paper, we addressed in social network visualization for people's interest in music. This visualization system designed for interest in music on social networks provides several capabilities: (A) visualization for friends who share the same interest in music, (B) to group people who share the same interest in music into categories, and (C) to recommend songs function for an increase in the common interest in music. These capabilities provide some essential capabilities for social networking analysis. Take the following for example: general users chat with others through instant messaging on social networks. Or perhaps, they would rather start up a discussion with other users. However, discussions of this kind that share similar interests can allow users to get to know others and improve interpersonal relationships. Afterwards, they can know their friends more about what they like and what dislike. In this dissertation, the research fellows need to handle the text information gathered from Plurk (the world-famous social network) to carry out regularization. We make use of the data mining method to analyze the information on the subject of music interest. We classify various types of songs. They also substitute these keywords called different degree of preference into the iSpreadRank algorithm to give different degree of preference. In our experience, this visualization system plays an essential rule in the analysis on social network."

We analyzed contact tracing data of 1147 Covid-19 positive cases (mean age 34.91 years, 61.99% aged 11–40, 742 males), anonymized and made public by the government. We used software tools Cytoscape and Gephi to create SNA graphics and determine network attributes of nodes (cases) and edges (directed links, determined by contact tracing, from source to target patients). Outdegree was 1–47 for 199 (17.35%) nodes, and betweenness 0.5–87 for 89 (7.76%) nodes. Men had higher mean outdegree and women, higher betweenness. Delhi was the exogenous source of 17.44% cases. Bangalore city had the highest caseload in the state (229, 20%), but comparatively low cluster formation. Thirty-four (2.96%) “super-spreaders” (outdegree≥5) caused 60% of the transmissions. Real-time social network visualization can allow healthcare administrators to flag evolving hotspots and pinpoint key actors in transmission. Prioritizing these areas and individuals for rigorous containment could help minimize resource outlay and potentially achieve a significant reduction in COVID-19 transmission."

For this task, the existing spherical embedding method, as well as the other standard graph embedding methods, can be used. However, these existing methods either produce poor visualization results or require extremely large computation time to obtain the final results. In order to overcome these shortcomings, we propose a new spherical embedding method based on a power iteration, which additionally performs two operations on the position vectors: double-centering and normalizing operations. Moreover, we theoretically prove that the proposed method always converges. In our experiments using bipartite graphs constructed from the Japanese sites of Yahoo!Movies and Yahoo!Answers, we show that the proposed method works much faster than these existing methods and still the visualization results are comparable to the best available so far."

Taylor,"Abstract : Hundreds of different representations of networks have been produced for different purposes. Many are very well suited to their purpose, but it is seldom clear how to generalize their insights to other situations. Networks can be described in many different ways, each representing an attribute of the network that might be useful if displayed for some user task, of which there are an indefinite number. The objective of a Framework is to provide some structure in this universe of possibility, in order to assist a user with a particular task to find a good way of displaying useful network attributes, or to help a designer produce a display that will help a range of users with a variety of related tasks. The IST-059/RTG-025 Working group on Framework for Network Visualisation has developed a conceptual structure for a Framework, based around two previously developed reference models for visualisation, a set of possible local and global dimensions of description of networks, the concept of embedding fields both for networks and for displays, a typology or taxonomy of data and display types, and a categorization of user task types. The resulting structure will be developed, along with the complementary IST-059/RTG-025 Survey of applications for network visualisation, into a structured guide for users, researchers, and developers."

This paper offers a five-layer hierarchy of network visualization situations with associated tasks: from simple node and link situations to more elaborate situations involving node labels, directed links, node attributes, and link attributes. Then, it offers a strategy based on tying node placement to node attributes within non-overlapping regions. These user-defined meaningful substrates enable users to easily see which links remain within a region or cross to other regions. Link visibility is controlled by check boxes so that selected subsets of links can be displayed. To further limit display clutter, users can set sliders to control which nodes within a region have their edges visible. We illustrate our meaningful substrate approach in a modest example with legal precedents for 49 cases with 368 precedents, and show these in our implementation of NVMS 1.0."

This paper shows how a paper co-authorship network can be explored using a graph visualization technique. The technique utilized builds upon the physics metaphor of traditional force-directed graph layouts to provide the user with interactive tools for the manipulation of the graph. These tools consist basically of magnets, which can be set to attract nodes and edges depending on their topological and semantic properties. In this work we show how they can be simply used to answer common questions about co-authorship networks. In the past few years the study of social networks has become especially relevant due to the growing popularity of applications that make use of them. In websites such as Facebook, MySpace, Orkut and Flickr, users can share, organize and find information as well as establish contacts depending on common interests. The analysis of social networks is necessary in many fields, including social and behavioral sciences, economy and marketing (Wasserman and Faust 1994). While this can be done using statistical studies and other procedures that do not have a visual output, it is often the case that producing a visual representation of the network might make the same information more accessible and reveal new traits and relationships that were previously undetectable. Since a social network is in essence a set of people and the relationships between them, the natural data structure to represent it is a graph. While information organized in graph-like structures can be usually explored textually, through tools such as query languages or the computation of metrics, this usually requires an expert user, being too complex and not intuitive enough for most people, who have little experience with such concepts. Therefore, many areas where graph structures apply, including social network applications, often require visualization techniques. By far, the most popular and intuitive visual representation of a graph is the node-link diagram. Different algorithms for such layout have been created, with each favoring certain aesthetic criteria. Some of these techniques are better for certain applications while some are better for others, but all have their limitations, which range from computational cost to visual clutter. To deal with the limitations of these layout algorithms, many approaches have been experimented. While some have applied navigation and interaction schemes on the traditional layouts (Abello and Korn 2002), Workshop on Information Visualization and Analysis in Social Networks - WIVA 2008"

The first O(n) algorithms for producing visibility representations were presented in [4, 5]. These were based on pre-processing to compute both an st-numbering and the dual of the planar graph, which were then used with the combinatorial planar embedding to produce a visibility representation. Greater efficiency is obtained in [3] by eliminating the need for the planar graph dual and by re-using the pre-computed st-numbering in the PQ-tree [1] algorithm."

However, representing non-visual data in a visual form does not automatically make the process of exploration and communication effective. The same data can be visualized in many different ways and different visualizations affect the process differently. Therefore, it is important to have the resultant visualizations evaluated so that their quality in conveying the embedded information to the end users can be understood. In designing an evaluation study, at least three issues need to be addressed: what kind of quality is to be evaluated? What methods are to be used? And what measures are to be used? A range of methods and measurements have been used to evaluate visualizations in the literature. Overall quality is often considered as a multidimensional construct and the elements of the construct have limitations in evaluating overall quality. In this chapter, we introduce two one-dimensional measures. The first one is an indirect measure called visualization efficiency that is based on task performance and mental effort measures, while the second is a direct measure that is based on aesthetic criteria. These new measures take into consideration the elements of its corresponding multidimensional construct and combine them into a single value. We review related work, explain how these measures work and discuss user studies that were conducted to validate them."

Second, we highlight edges that are being traced at any given moment or have been the focus of recent attention. Third, we track recently viewed nodes and increase the saliency of their neighborhoods.

This paper presents a novel approach for dynamically rearranging the network layouts by incorporating centroidal Voronoi tessellation for better readability of node labels. Our idea is to smoothly transform the network layouts obtained through the conventional force-directed algorithm to that produced by the centroidal Voronoi tessellation to seek a plausible compromise between them. We also incorporated the Chebyshev distance metric into the centroidal Voronoi tessellation while adaptively adjusting the aspect ratios of the Voronoi cells so that we can place rectangular labels compactly over the network nodes. Finally, we applied the proposed approach to relatively large networks to demonstrate the feasibility of our formulation especially in interactive environments."

In this paper, we describe an advanced graph visualization that supports users with these activities. It reduces several problems of common graph visualizations and provides a specific chain arrangement of nodes that facilitates visual tracking of relationships. We present a concrete implementation for the exploration of relationships between images based on shared tags. An evaluation with a comparative user study shows good performance results on several dimensions. We therefore conclude that the ChainGraph approach can be considered a serious alternative to common graph visualizations in situations where relationships and commonalities between contents are of interest. After a discussion of the limitations, we finally point to some application scenarios and future enhancements."

Homan, Jonathan Schull","We have developed (1) a graph visualization system that allows users to explore graphs by viewing them as a succession of spanning trees selected interactively, (2) a radial graph layout algorithm, and (3) an animation algorithm that generates meaningful visualizations and smooth transitions between graphs while minimizing edge crossings during transitions and in static layouts. n Our system is similar to the radial layout system of Yee et al. (2001), but differs primarily in that each node is positioned on a coordinate system centered on its own parent rather than on a single coordinate system for all nodes. Our system is thus easy to define recursively and lends itself to parallelization. It also guarantees that layouts have many nice properties, such as: it guarantees certain edges never cross during an animation. n We compared the layouts and transitions produced by our algorithms to those produced by Yee et al. Results from several experiments indicate that our system produces fewer edge crossings during transitions between graph drawings, and that the transitions more often involve changes in local scaling rather than structure. n These findings suggest the system has promise as an interactive graph exploration tool in a variety of settings."

This data comprises a large, complex set of related words that presents an interesting analytical challenge. The relationships among words in the news articles were extracted using Centering Resonance Analysis (CRA). In this paper, we present two secondary analyses of the CRA networks. The first analysis involves a two-dimensional layered grid approach using convex hulls for examining the intersection and union of sets of words in the text in a two-dimensional projection. Additional SVG versions of these images allow exploration of the solutions interactively. The second approach involves the use of three-dimensional interactive visualizations and centrality analysis using the molecular visualization program Mage. A major guiding question of this work is the following: Can we gain knowledge about the conflicts within and dynamics of the Bush team from a visual exploration and analysis of the CRA data over the 66 days of the text? The analysis of the news text using these approaches suggests that Powell has played less of a role during the 66 days of the analysis then might be expected given his formal status as chief foreign policy advisor to the President."

The ability to design and visualize architecture models efficiently and accurately has a direct impact on the ability of designers to satisfy the requirements of their stakeholders. The Monterey Phoenix (MP) program is one such application for building executable architecture models. The MP program is used to build and test models based upon inter-related events between the user-environment, program processes and data. At the heart of architecture analysis in MP is the accurate creation of high-level graphs that depict the details of both software architectures and event traces of resulting architectures. To date, development of these graphs has been a fragmented, manual process that often relies on shoe-horning other applications into tasks for which those programs were never intended to be used. This thesis implements MPGrapher, an LL1, single-pass compiler that generates XML documents for visualizing MP architectures and event traces. It is based on generating files that conform to the Graph Markup Language (GraphML). MPGrapher compiles well-formed XML files that conform to the yEd GraphML schema.

The study of such communities is crucial in exploring the structure of a network, especially when small communities form larger ones that in turn group together to build even larger ones, resulting in a hierarchy. Besides, fence-sitting nodes, nodes shared among different communities, are common in real networks. Although a large amount of network visualization tools are available, few could visualize the hierarchical community structure and fence-sitting nodes. Thus, we proposed visualization methods and accordingly developed a network visualization tool to dynamically uncover the hierarchical community structure and reveal fence-sitting nodes. Tests on a yeast network yielded satisfying results."

The main feature of this method is that it applies Level-Of-Detail (LOD) strategy to graph visualization and navigation, and allows the user to navigate the graph in real time. First, the algorithm calculates the weight for each vertex by an improved link analysis method. Second, representative vertices with higher weights are selected. Third, a wavefront algorithm is utilized to cluster neighboring vertices for each representative vertex. This step produces several clusters characterized by the representative vertices. Then steps two and three are repeated in each cluster to form an LOD tree. Finally, we use a force-directed method to draw the sub-graph under the non-leaf node of the LOD tree. Based on the proposed method, we develop a graph visualization and navigation systemxe2x80x94DynamicViewer. We then demonstrate its application in Web navigation. With DynamicViewer, the user can have an overview of the Web and then browse individual information on demand. The experiment results show that DynamicViewer enhances the ability to provide the right information to the user."

To achieve a graph abstraction, a hierarchical clustered graph is extracted from a general large graph based on the community structures discovered in the graph. An enclosure geometrical partitioning algorithm is then applied to achieving the space optimization. For graph drawing, it uses a combination of spring-embbeder and circular drawing algorithms that archives the goal of optimization of display space and aesthetical niceness. The paper also discusses an interaction mechanism accompanied with the layout solution. The interaction not only allows users to navigate hierarchically through the entire clustered graph, but also provides a way to navigate multiple clusters concurrently. Animation is also implemented to preserve user mental maps during the interaction."

In this work we introduce a novel subgraph concept to capture the cohesion in social interactions, and propose an I/O efficient approach to discover cohesive subgraphs.n n Besides, we propose an analytic system which allows users to perform intuitive, visual browsing on large scale social networks. Our system stores the network as a social graph in the graph database, retrieves a local cohesive subgraph based on the input keywords, and then hierarchically visualizes the subgraph out on orbital layout, in which more important social actors are located in the center. By summarizing textual interactions between social actors as tag cloud, we provide a way to quickly locate active social communities and their interactions in a unified view."

Purchase, Fabien Jourdan","Metabolic networks have been drawn manually for many years, and over time have developed representational conventions that make them familiar to biologists. With increasing current biological discoveries, these networks need to be frequently updated and modified, and automatic visualization algorithms are thus becoming a necessity. Many existing automatic graph layout algorithms exist, and it is not known whether such generic algorithms are sufficiently useful for biologists, or whether algorithms that specifically consider the existing representational conventions are necessary. No prior task efficiency evaluation studies have been performed on biological network visualizations. This paper reports on an experiment comparing the task efficiency of biologically relevant motif-search tasks using three layouts, two of which were produced using existing generic graph layout algorithms (Force Directed, Hierarchical), and one which was specifically designed to take existing metabolic representation conventions into account (MetaViz). Despite the search task favouring the easy identification of node connectivity in the Force Directed layout, the results showed no efficiency difference between Force Directed and MetaViz. We conclude that embodying the representational conventions in an automatic algorithm is not an impediment to task efficiency, and that some minor improvements to MetaViz would enhance its usefulness for biologists even further."

These attack graphs, however, are often complex and difficult to comprehend fully, and a human user may find it problematic to reach appropriate configuration decisions. This paper presents methodologies that can 1) automatically identify portions of an attack graph that do not help a user to understand the core security problems and so can be trimmed, and 2) automatically group similar attack steps as virtual nodes in a model of the network topology, to immediately increase the understandability of the data. We believe both methods are important steps toward improving visualization of attack graphs to make them more useful in configuration management for large enterprise networks. We implemented our methods using one of the existing attack-graph toolkits. Initial experimentation shows that the proposed approaches can 1) significantly reduce the complexity of attack graphs by trimming a large portion of the graph that is not needed for a user to understand the security problem, and 2) significantly increase the accessibility and understandability of the data presented in the attack graph by clearly showing, within a generated visualization of the network topology, the number and type of potential attacks to which each host is exposed."

Even so, the number of participants in many studies is relatively small as, for example, in typical clinical trials. Here we suggest an approach based on network visualization, combined with resampling, to discern the patterns of relationships among variables. We illustrate how this can be applied to analyze changes in multiple outcomes in people with dementia. The relationships between several dozens of variables were represented by connectivity graphs, drawn by calculating the relative risk of observing a pair of symptoms in an individual to their co-occurrence by chance only. The statistical significance of the relationships was calculated by generating a bootstrap sample. If the null hypothesis (e.g., the relative risks = 1 or equivalently, the pointwise mutual information = 0) was rejected, the vertices on the graph representing the variables were connected by an edge. The number of edges (the degree of connectivity) reflects the stage of the cognitive impairment, with worse dementia indicated by lower connectivity. Arranging symptoms consistently allows characteristic profiles to be displayed; this in turn can allow patterns of treatment effects to be discerned, with at-a-glance pattern recognition."

Recent papers remark that these systems are especially useful if they measure the users' interest into the relevant concepts described in a Web site rather than counting users' accesses to the distinct pages forming theWeb site. This paper extends existing measures of conceptual Web site traffic analysis and describes a system, called COWA, that supports this analysis by means of network models and graph visualization technologies. The graph drawing algorithmic core of the user interface of COWA is a force directed heuristic that computes a simultaneous embedding of two non-planar graphs. This heuristic optimizes the visualizations in terms of crossing resolution and user's geodesic tendency.

The widely used node-link diagrams excel at this task, but many are difficult to extract meaning from because of the inherent complexity of the relationships and limited screen space. To help address this problem we introduce a technique called motif simplification, in which common patterns of nodes and links are replaced with compact and meaningful glyphs. Well-designed glyphs have several benefits: they (1) require less screen space and layout effort, (2) are easier to understand in the context of the network, (3) can reveal otherwise hidden relationships, and (4) preserve as much underlying information as possible. We tackle three frequently occurring and high-payoff motifs: fans of nodes with a single neighbor, connectors that link a set of anchor nodes, and cliques of completely connected nodes. We contribute design guidelines for motif glyphs; example glyphs for the fan, connector, and clique motifs; algorithms for detecting these motifs; a free and open source reference implementation; and results from a controlled study of 36 participants that demonstrates the effectiveness of motif simplification."

Vance, Deborah L. Thurston","With the goal of making product recovery economically viable, disassembly sequence planning and evaluation can be used to influence product design features early in the product design process. Several researchers have investigated using optimization methods to determine disassembly sequences. One of the difficulties with using this approach is that because of the unique aspects of product disassembly at the end of life, input parameters for the optimization algorithms are commonly unavailable or estimated under high uncertainty. In practice, design engineers explore disassembly sequencing using either CAD software or manipulation of physical prototypes. These approaches produce solutions, but only intuitive solutions are explored and more optimal solutions may exist. To support decision making early in the design process, the research presented in this paper combines these two approaches within an immersive computing technology (ICT) application to aid in early product design with the goal of designing products with consideration of product recovery, reuse and recycle. The ICT application displays both 3D geometry of the product to be disassembled and an interactive graph visualization of the potential disassembly paths. The user can naturally interact with the geometric models and explore the potential paths indicated by the graph visualization. The optimal path can be indicated and the user can explore other potential paths. The result is an application that combines the strength of mathematical modeling with visualization and human interaction to provide an experience where the user can explore potential effects of design decisions. The initial application has been implemented in a 3 wall immersive projection environment and preliminary results show this approach proves to be an efficient method of evaluating and training potential disassembly sequences."

Specifically, within the context of terror network analysis, one of the largest problems is the transformation of raw tabular data into a visualization that is easily and effectively exploited by intelligence analysts. Currently, the primary method within the intelligence do-main is the node-link visualization, which encodes data sets by depicting the ties between nodes as lines between objects in a plane. This method, although useful, has limitations when the size and complexity of data grows. The matrix offers an alternate perspective because the two dimensions of the matrix are arrayed as an actors x actors matrix.

This requires the quick production of a sequence of graph visualizations. However, the traditional force-directed graph drawing algorithms are very slow to reach an equilibrium configuration of forces. They usually spend tens of seconds producing the layout of a graph converge. Thus, they do not satisfy the requirement of rapid drawing of graphs. This paper proposes a fast convergence method for drawing force-directed graphs. We essentially pre-calculate the geometrical position of all vertices before applying a force-directed layout algorithm to reach the energy minimization of the graph layout. The experimental results have shown that this approach could not only reduce the convergence time but also the number of edge crossings that approves the quality of layout significantly."

This demands high effectiveness of the drawing algorithms to produce layout of graphs with few edge crossings. However, the classical force-directed algorithms fail to satisfy this requirement. In this paper, we solve this problem by using a novel and heuristic pre-positioning method based on a variant of the PageRank algorithm. In our algorithmic framework, five models are proposed to calculate the importance degree of each vertex, the relation matrix of the vertices, the layer each vertex belongs to, the available placing coordinates and the matching coefficient between a vertex and a position. After the pre-positioning procedure of each layer, the classical force-directed algorithm is used to calculate the final position of each vertex.

A large part of the problem is that in network data, users not only have to visualize the attributes specific to each data item, but also the links specifying how those items are connected to each other. Past approaches to resolving these difficulties focus on zooming, clustering, filtering and applying various methods of laying out nodes and edges. Such approaches, however, focus only on optimizing a network visualization in a single view, limiting the amount of information that can be shown and explored in parallel. Moreover, past approaches do not allow users to cross reference different subsets or aspects of large, complex networks. In this paper, we propose an approach to these limitations using multiple coordinated views of a given network.

As a result, detailed analysis frequently becomes tedious and error-prone. Although network simulators such as the VINT project's ns can easily generate numerous detailed traces, they provide limited help for analyzing and understanding the data. Nam, the network animator that we developed in our work at the VINT project, provides packet-level animation, protocol graphs, traditional time-event plots of protocol actions, and scenario editing capabilities. Nam benefits from a close relationship with ns, which can collect detailed protocol information from a simulation. With some preprocessing. Nam can visualize data taken directly from real network traces."

Thomas","Many real-world networks are multivariate, i.e., they have attributes associated with nodes and/or edges. Examples include social networks whose nodes represent people and edges represent relationships. There is usually information about each person (such as name, age, and gender) and the relationship (such type, duration, and strength). Besides common graph analysis tasks (such as identifying the most influential or structurally important nodes), there are more complex analyses for multivariate networks. One of these is the multivariate graph clustering, i.e., identifying clusters formed by nodes that have similar attributes and are close to each other in terms of graph distance. For instance, in social network analysis, it is interesting to sociologists whether or not people with similar characteristics (node attributes) are also connected to each other. Currently there are very few visualization methods available for such analysis. Graph and multivariate visualization have been well studied separately in the literature. Herman et al. summarized the recent work on graph visualization [3], and Wong and Bergeron covered the development in multivariate visualization [4]. However, there is relatively less work available on multivariate network visualization. Two types of approaches are commonly used. The first one is the mapping approach, which maps attributes to visual elements of a node or edge. A simple example is to map one attribute to node size and another to node color [2]. A more advanced mapping approach uses glyphs to represent node or edge attributes. One such example is to use the length and width of a rectangle node glyph to represent two node attributes [1]. The second one is the 2.5D approach: it uses the third dimension to present the multivariate information, while the graph is shown on a 2D plane. Examples include the recently proposed GraphScape [5], which adopts a landscape metaphor: each attribute is represented by a two-and-a-half- dimensional surface, whose height indicates its value. Each approach has its strength and weakness. The mapping approach is effective of showing numerical value using visual element such as size, but it can be difficult to compare the value of attributes represented by different elements such as size and color. The problem is alleviated by a carefully designed glyph, but visual complexity increases quickly as the number of attributes that a glyph needs to represent grows. The 2.5D approach is good at showing the distribution of attribute values over the network, but the attribute surface could introduce occlusion and affect the visibility of underlying network. In this paper, we present a study evaluating the effectiveness of these two approaches for different analysis tasks. We compare the performance of mapping and 2.5D approach in a controlled lab environment. We included both simple tasks (such as identifying nodes with the largest attribute value) and complex tasks (such as multivariate graph clustering). The performance is measured both in terms of accuracy and completion time. The results indicate that statistically mapping approach performs better for the simple tasks, while the 2.5D approach is favored in the complex task. The outcomes from this study provide some guidelines for the design of effective multivariate graph visualization for different analysis tasks."

Shelley, Mehmet Hadi Gunes","Advanced techniques are needed to understand the underlying topologies of large complex networks. This paper introduces a novel way to address the issue of visualizing large-scale network topologies. We propose an inner sphere visualization method that projects the network topology on the inside of a sphere. User navigation around the network is accomplished through moving the sphere around the user's point of view. Previous research has shown that the spatial cognition ability in humans greatly affects the usefulness of a user interface. In this direction, we performed two empirical experiments to test the usefulness of viewing topologies on a sphere compared to a flat surface. The user study indicates that network navigation on a sphere is faster but can also be confusing. Thus, we add guidance tips to create a more intuitive user interface and to improve navigability. Our inner sphere visualization method is implemented as a tool for dynamic interactive network visualization called GerbilSphere (available at http://cse.unr.edu/~mgunes/gerbilSphere)."

Hero","Many real-world networks, including social and information networks, are dynamic structures that evolve over time. Such dynamic networks are typically visualized using a sequence of static graph layouts. In addition to providing a visual representation of the network structure at each time step, the sequence should preserve the mental map between layouts of consecutive time steps to allow a human to interpret the temporal evolution of the network. In this paper, we propose a framework for dynamic network visualization in the on-line setting where only present and past graph snapshots are available to create the present layout. The proposed framework creates regularized graph layouts by augmenting the cost function of a static graph layout algorithm with a grouping penalty, which discourages nodes from deviating too far from other nodes belonging to the same group, and a temporal penalty, which discourages large node movements between consecutive time steps. The penalties increase the stability of the layout sequence, thus preserving the mental map. We introduce two dynamic layout algorithms within the proposed framework, namely dynamic multidimensional scaling and dynamic graph Laplacian layout. We apply these algorithms on several data sets to illustrate the importance of both grouping and temporal regularization for producing interpretable visualizations of dynamic networks."

McIntyre, Richard E. Strauss","We employed a sliding-window approach at multiple scales (window sizes and dispersal distances) to calculate seven standard graph-theoretical metrics within a subset of a large, freshwater wetland network. In contrast to most graph analyses, which quantify connectivity at a single (global) scale or at a patch-level scale, a multi-scaled, sliding-window approach provides an assessment that bridges these two approaches to examine patch clusters. As a case study we focused on a subset of a habitat patch network in a ~20,000xc2xa0km2 area encompassing 2,782 playa wetlands in the panhandle of Texas. Playas are seasonal wetlands of the southern Great Plains of North America that form a network of regional habitat resources for wildlife. The large size of this network meant that global metrics failed to capture localized properties, so we used contour mapping to visualize continuous surfaces as functions of playa density, linkage density, and other topological traits at different window sizes and dispersal distances. This technique revealed spatial patterns in the components (i.e., the network properties of regions of the landscape at a given dispersal scale), with the spatial scale of habitat clustering varying with the size of the sliding window and dispersal distance. Using a tool familiar to landscape ecology (sliding-window methodology) in a novel way (to examine ecological networks at multiple scales), our approach provides a way to represent ecologically determined local-scale graph properties and illustrates how a multi-scaled approach is useful in examining habitat connectivity to investigate graph properties."

Recent studies have shown that human connectomes can be constructed using various neuroimaging technologies and further characterized using sophisticated analytic strategies, such as graph theory. These methods reveal the intriguing topological architectures of human brain networks in healthy populations and explore the changes throughout normal development and aging and under various pathological conditions. However, given the huge complexity of this methodology, toolboxes for graph-based network visualization are still lacking. Here, using MATLAB with a graphical user interface (GUI), we developed a graph-theoretical network visualization toolbox, called BrainNet Viewer, to illustrate human connectomes as ball-and-stick models. Within this toolbox, several combinations of defined files with connectome information can be loaded to display different combinations of brain surface, nodes and edges. In addition, display properties, such as the color and size of network elements or the layout of the figure, can be adjusted within a comprehensive but easy-to-use settings panel. Moreover, BrainNet Viewer draws the brain surface, nodes and edges in sequence and displays brain networks in multiple views, as required by the user. The figure can be manipulated with certain interaction functions to display more detailed information. Furthermore, the figures can be exported as commonly used image file formats or demonstration video for further use. BrainNet Viewer helps researchers to visualize brain networks in an easy, flexible and quick manner, and this software is freely available on the NITRC website (www.nitrc.org/projects/bnv/)."

Often these networks are dynamic: they have a structural as well as a temporal aspect. In addition to relations occurring over time, node information is frequently present such as hierarchical structure or time-series data. We present a technique that extends the Massive Sequence View ( msv) for the analysis of temporal and structural aspects of dynamic networks. Using features in the data as well as Gestalt principles in the visualization such as closure, proximity, and similarity, we developed node reordering strategies for the msv to make these features stand out that optionally take the hierarchical node structure into account. This enables users to find temporal properties such as trends, counter trends, periodicity, temporal shifts, and anomalies in the network as well as structural properties such as communities and stars. We introduce the circular msv that further reduces visual clutter. In addition, the (circular) msv is extended to also convey time-series data associated with the nodes. This enables users to analyze complex correlations between edge occurrence and node attribute changes.

Traditional visualization tools only take account into the links in the networks when displaying them. However, social networks are inherently attached to abundant attribute information. In order to display their attribute information, a novel visualization tool with attribute-based layout and coloring is developed in this paper. The core of this tool are two algorithms: one for node layout and the other for node coloring. These two algorithms are designed based on the principle of making the nodes with same attribute values closer in the diagram. The experiments on synthetic networks and real-world networks show that this tool can return more reasonable visualization."

As a result, research activities, which include prototyping, implementation, demonstration and experiments, conducted over OpenFlow networks have been a worldwide tendency. In such research activities, however, the difficulty in understanding network topology, traffic amount and an actual path of a network flow on the OpenFlow network, and the intricacies in debugging software designed for OpenFlow are serious problems in the development process of OpenFlow controller.

Despite considerable progress in understanding the structural characteristics of rock masses, the complexity of discontinuity patterns has prevented satisfactory analysis based on a 3-D rock mass visualization model. This paper presents the results of studies performed to develop rock mass visualization in 3-D to analysis the mechanical and hydraulic behavior of fractured rock masses. General and particular solutions of non-linear equations of disk-shaped fractures have been derived to calculated lines of intersection and equivalent pipes. Also, program modules have been developed to perform the calculations. The procedures developed for the 3-D fractured rock mass visualization model can be used to characterize rock mass geometry and network systems effectively. The results obtained in this study will be refined and then combined for use as a tool for assessing geomechanical problems related to strength, deformability and hydraulic behaviors of the fractured rock masses."

2025035988,21816,Co-Citation Count vs Correlation For Influence Network Visualization,2003-09-01,14,10,,55152591,2003,Information Visualization,"Steven Noel, Chee-Hung Henry Chu, Vijay V. Raghavan","Visualization of author or document influence networks as a two-dimensional image can provide key insights into the direct influence of authors or documents on each other in a document collection. The influence network is constructed based on the minimum spanning tree, in which the nodes are documents and an edge is the most direct influence between two documents. Influence network visualizations have typically relied on co-citation correlation as a measure of document similarity. That is, the similarity between two documents is computed by correlating the sets of citations to each of the two documents. In a different line of research, co-citation count (the number of times two documents are jointly cited) has been applied as a document similarity measure. In this work, we demonstrate the impact of each of these similarity measures on the document influence network. We provide examples, and analyze the significance of the choice of similarity measure. We show that correlation-based visualizations exhibit chaining effects (low average vertex degree), a manifestation of multiple minor variations in document similarities. These minor similarity variations are absent in count-based visualizations. The result is that count-based influence network visualizations are more consistent with the intuitive expectation of authoritative documents being hubs that directly influence large numbers of documents.

State space allows a 3D representation that is more representative of anatomical structure and electrical activity. This paper demonstrates how novel visualisation techniques allow easier identification of anomalies. The methods employed use Takenxe2x80x99s state-space theory to plot the amplitude of user selected leads on the relative axes in the state space domain. By plotting the combined values of separate leads, the direct relationship between the different viewing angles of the electrodes can be seen. A graphical user interface (GUI) was developed to view MIT-BIH database files, and files from a cardiology clinic, in various state-space formats. This software allows the user to rotate the 3D models and provides a cross-sectional view of the plots at user selected coordinates. The usefulness of these models were determined by combining the orthogonal views of leads I, aVF, and V2. This enabled the user to collaborate the vector values of the lead locations with the conventional ECG characteristics."

Finding insights into these time-varying data sets is a challenging task. Visualization techniques such as heat maps or gaze plots help find patterns in the data but highly aggregate the data (heat maps) or are difficult to read due to overplotting (gaze plots). In this paper, we propose transforming eye movement data into a dynamic graph data structure to explore the visualization problem from a new perspective. By aggregating gaze trajectories of participants over time periods or Areas of Interest (AOIs), a fair trade-off between aggregation and details is achieved. We show that existing dynamic graph visualizations can be used to display the transformed data and illustrate the approach by applying it to eye tracking data recorded for investigating the readability of tree diagrams."

Frequently, the nodes of the graph represent objects that have their own intrinsic properties with associated distances or similarity measures. In particular, we investigate graphing of spoligoforests to visualize the genetic relatedness between strains of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex using multiple genetic markers. It is often desirable, that drawings of such graphs map nodes from high-dimensional feature space to low-dimensional vectors that preserve these pairwise distances. This desired quality is frequently expressed as a function of the embedding and then optimized, eg. Multidimensional Scaling (MDS), the goal is to minimize the difference between the actual distances and Euclidean distances between all nodes in the embedding."

In this paper, we introduce a visualization technique for time-varying graphs that is scalable with respect to the number of time steps. The graph visualization is based on the Parallel Edge Splatting technique, which employs a space-efficient display of a sequence of dynamically changing graphs. To illustrate the usefulness of our approach we analyzed method call graphs recorded during the execution of the open source software system JHotDraw. Furthermore, we studied a time-varying social network representing researchers and their dynamic communication structure while attending the ACM Hypertext 2009 conference."

The trust network visualization is a key to explore the mechanism of trust propagation and study the trust evaluation. Most existing network visualization approaches only take into account the undirected and unweighted graphs, which cannot illustrate the asymmetry and the discreteness of trust relationships. To solve this issue, we define the public influence weight, the trust strength and the trust distance in this paper and propose the force-directed visualization algorithm for trust network. In the visualization algorithm, the desirable length between two nodes is determined by the trust strength so as to cluster trusted entities, and the forces between two different nodes are determined by their public influence weights so as to center on the heavyweight entities. Finally, the visualization experiments are carried out on the Epinions data set and the performance of the proposed algorithm is compared with the classical force-directed layout algorithm. The experimental results show that it can reveal the nature of communities better."

This paper concentrates on one visual fault known as shading variation, a result of color pigments registering as light, dark, or irregular.

For graph visualization, a clustering algorithm should meet specific requirements such as the sufficient size of clusters, and automatic determination of the number of clusters. After identifying the requirements of clustering graphs for visualization, in this paper we present a new clustering algorithm that is particularly designed for visualization so as to reduce the visual complexity of a layout, together with a strategy for improving the scalability of our algorithm.

Interactive graph layout is often important since it is difficult to statically lay out complex graphs such as general undirected graphs. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to interactive layout of general undirected graphs. The basic idea of our approach is to use static graph layouts in high-dimensional spaces to dynamically find two-dimensional layouts according to user interaction. The resulting method that we present exhibits the following two characteristics: (1) it efficiently updates two-dimensional graph layouts during user interaction; (2) it follows users' node dragging operations by actively moving other closely related nodes. Our method adopts eigenvector-based multidimensional scaling to compute high-dimensional graph layouts, and performs constraint satisfaction to determine appropriate two-dimensional planes onto which the high-dimensional layouts will be projected."

The NetViz designs abstract and unify data required by an S6 into a single view. They allow for the visualization of data to support S6 reporting during an update brief. Visual designs for xe2x80x9cwhat ifxe2x80x9d scenarios and future events also facilitate planning for both the expected and the unexpected.

In this distributed network of compute-display nodes, the display devices form a geometrically contiguous tiled display wall, and the data distribution among the compute-display nodes for algorithmic purposes is related to the data distribution to its corresponding display nodes for visualization purposes. This approach collocates computation and visualization within the same node and minimizes network bandwidth requirement for data exchange between nodes. Leveraging the advantages of the above novel system design, we also present a distributed force directed graph layout algorithm. In this distributed algorithm, we address two issues specific to tiled displays: number of edges crossing the display panel boundaries (across two different compute-display clients) and the location of graph vertices close to panel boundaries which may lead to incorrect visual analytic conclusions. We integrate the cost functions expressing the above two effects along with the cost function of the edge-crossings within each display into the graph layout algorithm. Using this distributed approach, for the first time a very large graph has been laid out in a large real estate provided by the tiled display. The proposed system is evaluated on various parameters including the scalability, the impact on display real-estate utilization, and finally, network bandwidth usage."

We suggest a novel modeling-driven approach to graph visualization: As usually in modeling, choose the (generative) model such that it captures what is important in the data. Then visualize similarity of the graph nodes with a suitable multidimensional scaling method, with similarity given by the model; we use a multidimensional scaling method optimized for a rigorous visual information retrieval task.

With the dramatic increase in the number of databases, data sets, tools, and software being used to store, retrieve, and analyze proteomic, genomic, and metabolomic data, researchers are being forced to navigate an ever-complex information environment. Medical librarians can accelerate data analysis by learning about, conducting comparative analyses for, and providing instruction on these resources. Many libraries, such as the University of Florida's Health Science Center Libraries and Washington University's Bernard Becker Medical Library, offer instruction on biomedical databases and tools such as those provided by the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) [1, 2]. Instruction on network visualization tools is not as commonly provided by libraries.n n Network visualization is a method of data analysis that uses nodes to represent a data point, such as a gene, and edges (lines connecting nodes) to represent a relationship between two data points, such as an interaction between two genes (Figure 1, online only). Nodes and edges can have attributes associated with them that provide additional information, such as the chromosome on which a gene is located. Network visualization is an effective method for representing biologic relationships by succinctly highlighting properties and trends in complex systems. Networks also allow the integration of multiple different kinds of data such as gene expression, ontologies, and protein structures that have traditionally been stored in their own repositories [3]. Network analysis and network modeling techniques are being applied to biological networks in order to provide new hypotheses for biological systems, and as a result, a large number of tools for visualizing networks are constantly being developed, used, and reviewed [4].n n Teaching biomedical resources such as network visualization tools, in addition to those developed by NCBI, is an area where medical librarians can make a significant impact. While resources like OpenHelix provide some instruction on these types of resources, these sources are limited, providing an important opportunity for libraries to expand the scope of their instruction curricula and to use instruction methods that allow broad participation by users.

Many techniques have been proposed that take a graph as input and produce a visualization solely based on its topology, seldom ever relying on the semantic attributes of nodes and edges. These automatic topology-based algorithms might generate aesthetically interesting layouts, but they neglect information that might be important for the user. Among these are the force-directed or energy minimization algorithms, which use physics analogies to produce satisfactory layouts. They consist of applying forces on the nodes, which move until the physical system enters a state of mechanical equilibrium. We propose an extension of this metaphor to include tools for the interactive manipulation of such layouts. These tools are comprised of magnets, which attract nodes with user-specified criteria to the regions surrounding the magnets. Magnets can be nested and also used to intuitively perform set operations such as union and intersection, becoming thus an intuitive visual tool for sorting through the datasets. To evaluate the technique we discuss how they can be used to perform common graph visualization tasks."

Subendocardial infarction with cardiac arrest was demonstrated as a sample phenotype; there were 332 primarily adjacent diagnoses, with 5423 relationships. Primary network visualization suggested a treatmentrelated complication phenotype and several rare diagnoses; re-clustering by secondary relationships revealed an emergent cluster of smokers with the metabolic syndrome. Network visualization reveals phenotypic patterns that may have remained occult in pairwise correlation analysis. Visualization of complex data, potentially offered as point-of-care tools on mobile devices, may allow clinicians and researchers to quickly generate hypotheses and gain deeper understanding of patient subpopulations."

Several approaches for network visualization, data ordering and coarse-graining accomplished this goal. However, there was no underlying theoretical framework linking these problems. Here we show an elegant, information theoretic data representation approach as a unified solution of network visualization, data ordering and coarse-graining. The optimal representation is the hardest to distinguish from the original data matrix, measured by the relative entropy. The representation of network nodes as probability distributions provides an efficient visualization method and, in one dimension, an ordering of network nodes and edges. Coarse-grained representations of the input network enable both efficient data compression and hierarchical visualization to achieve high quality representations of larger data sets. Our unified data representation theory will help the analysis of extensive data sets, by revealing the large-scale structure of complex networks in a comprehensible form."

Typical collaborative workspaces often have a large number of objects and relations as well as their associated domain-specific attributes. The visualization of these domain-specific attributes is the challenge of this research. This paper presents a new approach for visualizing the attributes of objects and relations in collaborative workspaces. This new visualization provides not only a structural view of the collaborative workspaces but also a graphical view of a variety of domain-specific attributes associated with collaborative objects and relations. This paper also describes a framework for the attributed visualization of collaborative workspaces."

We are interested on large graphs, with hundreds of thousands of nodes. Such graphs bring two challenges: the first one is that any straightforward interactive manipulation will be prohibitively slow. The second one is sensory overload: even if we could plot and replot the graph quickly, the user would be overwhelmed with the vast volume of information because the screen would be too cluttered as nodes and edges overlap each other.Our GMine system addresses both these issues, by using summarization and multi-resolution. GMine offers multi-resolution graph exploration by partitioning a given graph into a hierarchy of communities-within-communities and storing it into a novel R-treelike structure which we name G-Tree. GMine offers summarization by implementing an innovative subgraph extraction algorithm and then visualizing its output."

Two different bag-of-words saliency metrics are introducedxe2x80x94global saliency and local saliency. Global saliency measures the rarity of an image throughout the entire data set, while local saliency describes the amount of texture richness in an image. The former is important in measuring an overall global saliency map for a given area, and is motivated from inverse document frequency (a measure of rarity) in information retrieval. Local saliency is defined by computing the entropy of the bag-of-words histogram, and is useful to avoid adding visually benign key frames to the map. The two different metrics are presented and experimentally evaluated with indoor and underwater imagery to verify their utility."

Forbes","In this paper we present a new technique and prototype graph visualization system, stereoscopic highlighting, to help answer accessibility and adjacency queries when interacting with a node-link diagram. Our technique utilizes stereoscopic depth to highlight regions of interest in a 2D graph by projecting these parts onto a plane closer to the viewpoint of the user. This technique aims to isolate and magnify specific portions of the graph that need to be explored in detail without resorting to other highlighting techniques like color or motion, which can then be reserved to encode other data attributes. This mechanism of stereoscopic highlighting also enables focuscontext views by juxtaposing a detailed image of a region of interest with the overall graph, which is visualized at a further depth with correspondingly less detail. In order to validate our technique, we ran a controlled experiment with 16 subjects comparing static visual highlighting to stereoscopic highlighting on 2D and 3D graph layouts for a range of tasks. Our results show that while for most tasks the difference in performance between stereoscopic highlighting alone and static visual highlighting is not statistically significant, users performed better when both highlighting methods were used concurrently. In more complicated tasks, 3D layout with static visual highlighting outperformed 2D layouts with a single highlighting method. However, it did not outperform the 2D layout utilizing both highlighting techniques simultaneously. Based on these results, we conclude that stereoscopic highlighting is a promising technique that can significantly enhance graph visualizations for certain use cases."

The graphs are drawn side-byside from left to right as a sequence of narrow stripes that are placed perpendicular to the horizontal time line. The hierarchically organized vertices of the graphs are arranged on vertical, parallel lines that bound the stripes; directed edges connect these vertices from left to right. To address massive overplotting of edges in huge graphs, we employ a splatting approach that transforms the edges to a pixel-based scalar field. This field represents the edge densities in a scalable way and is depicted by non-linear color mapping. The visualization method is complemented by interaction techniques that support data exploration by aggregation, filtering, brushing, and selective data zooming. Furthermore, we formalize graph patterns so that they can be interactively highlighted on demand. A case study on software releases explores the evolution of call graphs extracted from the JUnit open source software project.

Engel","In many application areas an optimal visualization of a complex graph depends on the specific task to be accomplished by the user. Therefore a means of locally customizable layouts is required to focus on different problem aspects. We propose a concept of user-driven hierarchy formation and layout optimization in the context of IBM zSeries I/O configurations. We combine the concepts of glyphs, local 3D layout managers and partitioning galaxies to create an optimal layout for a given task. Additionally, to simplify global navigation, structural details are abstracted and can be refined upon user request. Since element context is crucial for understanding and consistently configuring an I/O configuration, guided navigation along the connections in this data structure is essential. To efficiently customize a graph layout, complex selection mechanisms are needed to quickly define the areas affected by a particular layout. Although we focus on IBM zSeries I/O configurations, the approach we present is quite generic and can be adopted for other fields of application."

Such performance-based measures have proved to be useful in their own right. There are some situations, however, where the performance measures alone may not be sensitive enough to detect differences. This limitation can be seen from the fact that the graph viewer may achieve the same level of performance by devoting different amounts of cognitive effort. In addition, it is not often that individual performance measures are consistently in favor of a particular visualization. This makes design and evaluation difficult in choosing one visualization over another. In an attempt to overcome the above-mentioned limitations, we measure the effectiveness of graph visualizations from a cognitive load perspective. Human memory as an information processing system and recent results from cognitive load research are reviewed first. The construct of cognitive load in the context of graph visualization is proposed and discussed. A model of user task performance, mental effort and cognitive load is proposed thereafter to further reveal the interacting relations between these three concepts. A cognitive load measure called mental effort is introduced and this measure is further combined with traditional performance measures into a single multi-dimensional measure called visualization efficiency. The proposed model and measurements are tested in a user study for validity. Implications of the cognitive load considerations in graph visualization are discussed."

These methods provided insight on the functioning of microbial metabolism and played a key role in the design of genetic modifications that can lead to strains of industrial interest. On the other hand, in the context of Systems Biology research, biological network visualization has reinforced its role as a core tool in understanding biological processes. However, it has been scarcely used to foster ME related methods, in spite of the acknowledged potential. In this work, an open-source software that aims to fill the gap between ME and metabolic network visualization is proposed, in the form of a plugin to the OptFlux ME platform. The framework is based on an abstract layer, where the network is represented as a bipartite graph containing minimal information about the underlying entities and their desired relative placement. The framework provides input/output support for networks specified in standard formats, such as XGMML, SBGN or SBML, providing a connection to genome-scale metabolic models. An user-interface makes it possible to edit, manipulate and query nodes in the network, providing tools to visualize diverse effects, including visual filters and aspect changing (e.g. colors, shapes and sizes). These tools are particularly interesting for ME, since they allow overlaying phenotype simulation results or elementary flux modes over the networks. The framework and its source code are freely available, together with documentation and other resources, being illustrated with well documented case studies."

Dynamic reconfiguration of networks enable rapid optimization of performance of a network, however, it poses several management difficulties when user intervention is required to resolve complex routing problems. Our metaphor scales well for networks of varying size, addresses the cluttering problem seen in past metaphors and maintains the overall network context while providing additional support for navigation and interaction. We apply the metaphor to three dynamic reconfiguration management tasks and show how these tasks are visually represented with our approach. We conducted an experiment with network administrators and researchers as subjects. A good understanding of network conditions portrayed in the metaphor was achieved within a short period."

Algorithms for drawing trees in general are segregated from algorithms for drawing graphs. In this paper we present a graph visualization system that uses a novel interconnection between a tree drawing algorithm and graph drawing techniques. First, the graph is transformed into a tree and nodes that have multiple parent connections within the graph are duplicated within the tree. While some of the connection information is lost during this transformation, the multiple connections can be regained by interactively displaying the details based on the degree of interest. We use an edgeless rings-based visualization which allows edge crossings and angular resolution issues to be eliminated and has a desirable aspect ratio of 1. Finally, a circular labeling method is used that provides user-friendly labels that do not overlap and clearly show node affiliation."

However, existing aesthetic criteria are useful only in judging the extents to which a drawing conforms to specific drawing rules. They have limitations in evaluating overall quality. Currently graph visualizations are mainly evaluated based on personal judgments and user studies for their overall quality. Personal judgments are not reliable while user studies can be costly to run. Therefore, there is a need for a direct measure of overall quality. In an attempt to meet this need, we propose a measurement that measures overall quality based on individual aesthetics and gives a single numerical score. We present a user study that validates this measure by demonstrating its sensibility in detecting quality changes and its capacity in predicting the performance of human graph comprehension. The implications of our proposed measure for future research are discussed."

Often, networks are visualized by point symbols and lines illustrating the nodes and the arcs, respectively. As the number of the nodes and links increases, the visual representation of the network needs generalization in order to keep the visual clarity of the image. To solve the problem considered, a methodology to aggregate nodes and links into hypernodes and hyper-links is developed. The algorithm, which is based on an information theoretic approach to reorder the adjacency matrix of the network, can generate hierarchies of hyper-networks. This kind of generalization algorithm can be used to construct images which visualize the main structures of the network. Some case studies demonstrate the algorithm."

The model relies on users' editing history and the relationships between user edits, especially revisions that void previous edits, known as reverts. Based on this model, we constructed Revert Graph, a tool that visualizes the overall conflict patterns between groups of users.

To assess the performance of one of those tools and to gain insight into the differences between how human catalogers and automated tools conduct these standard assignments, we explore the use of network modeling and visualization techniques for comparing and contrasting the two. The results show significant differences between the human-based and machine-based network maps. Unlike the machine-based maps, the human-based assignment maps elegantly reflect the rationales and principles of the assignments; i.e., clusters of standards separate along lines of content and pedagogical principles.

Assuming a uniform distribution of metric values during either partitioning or coloring can have undesired effects such as empty clusters or only one level of emphasis for the entire graph.

However, users may want to focus on important nodes and their connections to groups of other nodes for some applications. For this purpose, it is effective to separately visualize the key nodes detected based on adjacency and attributes of the nodes. This article presents a graph visualization technique for attribute-embedded graphs that applies a graph-clustering algorithm that accounts for the combination of connections and attributes. The graph clustering step divides the nodes according to the commonality of connected nodes and similarity of feature value vectors. It then calculates the distances between arbitrary pairs of clusters according to the number of connecting edges and the similarity of feature value vectors and finally places the clusters based on the distances. Consequently, the technique separates important nodes that have connections to multiple large clusters and improves the visibility of such nodes' connections. To test this technique, this article presents examples with human relationship graph datasets, including a coauthorship and Twitter communication network dataset."

For networks larger than xe2x88xbc100 nodes and xe2x88xbc200 links, ball-and-stick diagrams fail to convey much information. To address this, we developed Network2Canvas (N2C), a web application that provides an alternative way to view networks. N2C visualizes networks by placing nodes on a square toroidal canvas. The network nodes are clustered on the canvas using simulated annealing to maximize local connections where a nodexe2x80x99s brightness is made proportional to its local fitness. The interactive canvas is implemented in HyperText Markup Language (HTML)5 with the JavaScript library Data-Driven Documents (D3). We applied N2C to visualize 30 canvases made from human and mouse gene-set libraries and 6 canvases made from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drug-set libraries. Given lists of genes or drugs, enriched terms are highlighted on the canvases, and their degree of clustering is computed. Because N2C produces visual patterns of enriched terms on canvases, a trained eye can detect signatures instantly. In summary, N2C provides a new flexible method to visualize large networks and can be used to perform and visualize gene-set and drug-set enrichment analyses.n n Availability: N2C is freely available at http://www.maayanlab.net/N2C and is open source.n n Contact: ude.mssm@nayaam.ivan n Supplementary information: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online."

OnionGraph allows nodes to be aggregated based on either node attributes, topology, or a mixture of both. Subsets of nodes can be flexibly split and merged under the hierarchical focuscontext interaction model, supporting sophisticated analysis of the network data. Node aggregations that contain subsets of nodes are displayed with multiple concentric circles, or the onion metaphor, indicating how many levels of abstraction they contain.

Mueller, B. Martin, Andrew Lumsdaine","In this study, we examine the use of graph ordering algorithms for visual analysis of data sets using visual similarity matrices. Visual similarity matrices display the relationships between data items in a dot-matrix plot format, with the axes labeled with the data items and points drawn if there is a relationship between two data items. The biggest challenge for displaying data using this representation is finding an ordering of the data items that reveals the internal structure of the data set. Poor orderings are indistinguishable from noise whereas a good ordering can reveal complex and subtle features of the data. We consider three general classes of algorithms for generating orderings: simple graph theoretic algorithms, symbolic sparse matrix reordering algorithms, and spectral decomposition algorithms. We apply each algorithm to synthetic and real world data sets and evaluate each algorithm for interpretability (i.e., does the algorithm lead to images with usable visual features?) and stability (i.e., does the algorithm consistently produce similar results?). We also provide a detailed discussion of the results for each algorithm across the different graph types and include a discussion of some strategies for using ordering algorithms for data analysis based on these results."

GraphScape adopts a landscape metaphor with network structure displayed on a 2D plane and the surface height in the third dimension represents node attribute. More than one attribute can be visualized simultaneously by using multiple surfaces. In addition, GraphScape can be easily combined with existing methods to further increase the total number of attributes visualized. One of the major goals of GraphScape is to reveal multivariate graph clustering, which is based on both network structure and node attributes. This is achieved by a new layout algorithm and an innovative way of constructing attribute surface, which also allows visual clustering at different scales through interaction. A simplified attribute surface model is also proposed to reduce computation requirement when visualizing large networks. GraphScape is applied to networks of three different size (20, 100, and 1500) to demonstrate its effectiveness."

An event starts at one node of the network, and then spreads to the edges of the network. In most cases, the underlying network structure that generates the diffusion process is unobserved, and we only observe the times at which each node is altered/influenced by the process. This paper proposes a probabilistic model for inferring the diffusion network, which we call Probabilistic Latent Network Visualization (PLNV); it is based on cascade data, a record of observed times of node influence. An important characteristic of our approach is to infer the network by embedding it into a low-dimensional visualization space. We assume that each node in the network has latent coordinates in the visualization space, and diffusion is more likely to occur between nodes that are placed close together. Our model uses maximum a posteriori estimation to learn the latent coordinates of nodes that best explain the observed cascade data. The latent coordinates of nodes in the visualization space can 1) enable the system to suggest network layouts most suitable for browsing, and 2) lead to high accuracy in inferring the underlying network when analyzing the diffusion process of new or rare information, rumors, and disease."

The navigation of the entire network is achieved by switching the focus node with user interactions. With this approach, the complexity of the compressed dynamic network is greatly reduced without sacrificing the network and time affinity central to the focus node. As a result, we are able to present each dynamic ego network in a single static view, well supporting user analysis on temporal network patterns. We describe our general framework including the network data pre-processing, 1.5D network and trend visualization design, layout algorithms, as well as several customized interactions.

Unfortunately, datasets are constantly growing in size, while devices have increasingly smaller screens (tablets, smartphones, etc). In order to reduce the quantity of elements displayed on screen, several techniques of information reduction can be used. Among them is graph clustering, which aggregates the elements of the original graph into clustered nodes and edges - thereby leading to a smaller graph. In this report, we present a tool for the interactive exploration and analysis of large clustered graphs. The tool empowers users to control the granularity of graphs either by direct interaction (collapsing/expanding clusters) or via a slider that automatically computes a clustered graph of the desired size. In a next step, we explore the use of learning algorithms to capture graph exploration preferences based on a history of user interactions.The learned parameters are then used to modify the action of the slider in view of mimicking the natural interaction/exploration behavior of the user."

Our interface encourages users to gain insight into a data set of 510 time series of 255 kinds of jobs. We include a case stud y that applies the SGV in a visual analytics environment and a usability study that evaluates the correlation be tween three implicit interest indicators (dwell time, view revisits, and mouse activity) and the explicit rating for a single view. The SGV was developed to record the views produced by 14 users and the explicit rating of those vie ws. Using the data collected by the SGV, the individual ratings and some combinations of explicit ratings were analyz ed and compared with the explicit rating. We found that the three implicit interest indicators had a strong corre lation with explicit interest."

The goal of this work is to develop and present a streamlined, reproducible approach to wireless visualization as well as techniques for predicting coverage area before conducting network installations. After evaluating these coverage maps, a repeated series of field measurements will be checked against interpolated values in order to improve techniques for extrapolation of data for unsampled regions. If successful, these extrapolation techniques will provide additional guidelines for, and assist modeling of, new wireless network installations. However, this paper demonstrates that due to the microcellular structure of indoor/outdoor 802.11b networks, accurate interpolation and propagation prediction techniques do not exist independent of highly specific location models.

Social networks follow a power-law degree distribution of nodes, with a few hub nodes and a long tail of peripheral nodes. While there exist consolidated approaches supporting the identification and characterization of hub nodes, research on the analysis of the multi-layered distribution of peripheral nodes is limited. In social media, hub nodes represent social influencers. However, the literature provides evidence of the multi-layered structure of influence networks, emphasizing the distinction between influencers and influence. Information seems to spread following multi-hop paths across nodes in peripheral network layers. This paper proposes a visual approach to the graphical representation and exploration of peripheral layers and clusters by exploiting the theory of k-shell decomposition analysis. The core concept of the proposed approach is to partition the node set of a graph into pre-defined hub and peripheral nodes. Then, a power-law based modified force-directed method is applied to clearly display local multi-layered neighborhood clusters around hub nodes based on a characterization of the content of message that we refer to as content specificity. We put forward three hypotheses that allow the graphical identification of the peripheral nodes that are more likely to be influential and contribute to the spread of information. Hypotheses are tested on a large sample of tweets from the tourism domain."

Problem-based Learning (PBL) is usually adopted to achieve such goals by encouraging students to learn by solving real-life problems. However, successful PBL requires sustained and in-depth involvement of faculty members, hence making PBL not scalable. Even though discussion forums and Q&A systems can help address the scalability problem of faculty involvement on large class sizes, it introduces new problems. First, as knowledge bases grow in size, the sheer size of the accumulated knowledge makes it harder to locate the desired information. Second, existing knowledge discovery techniques do not provide effective facilities for the capture and reuse of solutions to recurring problems.n To address these challenges, we developed MicroBrowser, an innovative and interactive Question & Answer (Q&A) system augmented with pattern-based expertise-sharing interfaces and 2D knowledge graph discussion visualization. MicroBrowser provides a set of pattern-based expertise-sharing interfaces to allow both learners and instructors to refine, reuse, and share knowledge. MicroBrowser also allows learners to browse and navigate important discussions based on topic similarity encoded by node proximity in a knowledge graph. n Results of empirical evaluations of our proposed solution show that ask difficulty improves with MicroBrowser when compared with a state-of-the-art Q&A system for knowledge discovery and reuse tasks. In addition, success rate for knowledge discovery tasks using keywords was higher with MicroBrowser. Moreover, we show that, students found the pattern-based expertise-sharing interface easy to use and were able to contribute new knowledge in the form of new knowledge connections and even recommend new design patterns."

Giannakis","Visual rendering of graphs is a key task in the mapping of complex network data. Although most graph drawing algorithms emphasize aesthetic appeal, certain applications such as travel-time maps place more importance on visualization of structural network properties. The present paper advocates two graph embedding approaches with centrality considerations to comply with node hierarchy. The problem is formulated first as one of constrained multi-dimensional scaling (MDS), and it is solved via block coordinate descent iterations with successive approximations and guaranteed convergence to a KKT point. In addition, a regularization term enforcing graph smoothness is incorporated with the goal of reducing edge crossings. A second approach leverages the locally-linear embedding (LLE) algorithm which assumes that the graph encodes data sampled from a low-dimensional manifold. Closed-form solutions to the resulting centrality-constrained optimization problems are determined yielding meaningful embeddings. Experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of both approaches, especially for visualizing large networks on the order of thousands of nodes."

A conventional network diagram of a xe2x80x9ccontact treexe2x80x9d maps out a root and branches that represent the structure of nodes and edges, often without further specifying leaves or fruits that would have grown from small branches. By furnishing such a network structure with leaves and fruits, we reveal details about xe2x80x9ccontactsxe2x80x9d in our ContactTrees upon which ties and relationships are constructed. Our elegant design employs a bottom-up approach that resembles a recent attempt to understand subjective well-being by means of a series of emotions. Such a bottom-up approach to social-network studies decomposes each tie into a series of interactions or contacts, which can help deepen our understanding of the complexity embedded in a network structure. Unlike previous network visualizations, ContactTrees highlight how relationships form and change based upon interactions among actors, as well as how relationships and networks vary by contact attributes. Based on a botanical tree metaphor, the design is easy to construct and the resulting tree-like visualization can display many properties at both tie and contact levels, thus recapturing a key ingredient missing from conventional techniques of network visualization. We demonstrate ContactTrees using data sets consisting of up to three waves of 3-month contact diaries over the 2004-2012 period, and discuss how this design can be applied to other types of datasets."

Starting from the actual network model, how could one manipulate this visualization to improve complexity comprehension? In this paper, we propose a solution called t rajectory. The trajectory has two major points of difference compared to the network: the trajectory a) represents not only distances, but also durations, and b) it displays kinetic entities according to their evolution with time. The discourse is articulated around these four points. Considering that networks are tools widely used by digital humanists, we propose a new language to improve the quality of represented data: a new network based on a vertical timeline. Complexification of the network visualization is not just a new language, but also a tool that would give the field of Digital Humanities the most complex of all possible visualizations."

A Vispol graph visualizes involved persons and their relations in crisis incidents like hostage takings or bank hold-ups. It presents a tabletop-based multi-touch and tangible user interface for the structured creation and manipulation of node-link diagrams. For instance, persons can be stamped into a graph with a stamp tangible object and links can be established employing multi-touch gestures. The graph can be visually filtered by applying layout algorithms via layout tangibles or by using a tangible magnet metaphor. We presented Vispol to the police to gather qualitative feedback. The police appreciated the visualization and generally liked the approach to use a multi-touch and tangible user interface. However, when it came to interacting with the tabletop system, police officers acted very cautiously and hesitatingly, as they were afraid of the new technology."
2280771347,21770,Dynamic Graph Visualization with Multiple Visual Metaphors,2015-08-24,27,3,2625874324,,2015,Visual Information Communication and Interaction (VINCI),Michael Burch,"Visualizing dynamic graphs is challenging due to the many data dimensions to be displayed such as graph vertices and edges with their attached weights or attributes and the additional time dimension. Moreover, edge directions with multiplicities and the graph topology are also important inherent features. However, in many dynamic graph visualization techniques each graph in a sequence is treated the same way, i.e., it is visually encoded in the same visual metaphor or even in the same layout. This visualization strategy can be problematic if the graphs are changing topologically over time, i.e., if a sparse graph becomes denser and denser over time or a star pattern is changing into a dense cluster of connected vertices. Such a dynamic graph data scenario demands for a visualization approach which is able to adapt the applied visual metaphor to each graph separately. In this paper we show an idea to solve this problem by using multiple visual metaphors for dynamic graphs which are computed automatically by algorithms analyzing each individual graph based on a given repertoire of graph features. The biggest issue in this technique for the graph dynamics, however, is the preservation of the viewer's mental map at metaphor changes, i.e., to guide him through the graph changes with the goal to explore the data for time-varying patterns. To reach this goal we support the analyst by an interactive highlighting feature."

The results of AINE are visualised in a specially developed tool (aiVIS), which allows the user to interact with the network to perform exploratory analysis. aiVIS presents AINs in such as way as to build up an understanding of the make up of the data set, learning about subtle patterns and clusters within the data set and links between clusters. Unclassified items can then be introduced into the network so to further enhance the exploratory nature of the AIN.

The platform enables the user to interact with the visualized graph in a way that is very similar to the exploration of maps at multiple levels. Our approach involves an offline preprocessing phase that builds the layout of the graph by assigning coordinates to its nodes with respect to a Euclidean plane. The respective points are indexed with a spatial data structure, i.e., an R-tree, and stored in a database. Multiple abstraction layers of the graph based on various criteria are also created offline, and they are indexed similarly so that the user can explore the dataset at different levels of granularity, depending on her particular needs. Then, our system translates user operations into simple and very efficient spatial operations (i.e., window queries) in the backend. This technique allows for a fine-grained access to very large graphs with extremely low latency and memory requirements and without compromising the functionality of the tool.

Verhoef, Mark Wade, Heiko Muller","Biologists generally interrogate genomics data using web-based genome browsers that have limited analytical potential. New generation genome browsers such as the Integrated Genome Browser (IGB) have largely overcome this limitation and permit customized analyses to be implemented using plugins. We illustrate the use of a plugin for IGB that exploits advanced visualization techniques to integrate the analysis of genomics data with network and structural approaches. We show how visualization technologies that combine both genomics and network biology can facilitate the selection of the key amino acid contacts from protein-protein and protein-drug interactions. Starting from the MDM2-P53 interaction, which is a high-value target for cancer therapy, and Nutlin, the parent small molecule of an MDM2 antagonist that is currently in clinical trials, we show that this method can be generalized to analyze how drugs and mutations can interfere with both protein-protein and drug-protein networks. We illustrate this point by two additional use-cases exploring the molecular basis of tamoxifen side effects and of drug resistance in chronic myeloid leukemia patients. Combined network and structure biology approaches provide key insights into both the genetic and the edgetic roles of variants in diseases. 3D interactomes facilitate the identification of disease-relevant interactions that can then be specifically targeted by drugs. Recent advances in molecular interaction and structure visualization tools have greatly simplified the mapping of mutated residues to molecular interaction interfaces. Such approaches can now also be integrated with genome visualization tools to enable comparative analyses of interaction contacts."

The multi-layered compression process groups vertices to form clusters and then abstracts the clusters as new vertices to define a new graph and is repeated until the graph size falls below some threshold. Based on the compressed graph, we optimise the display area to top-down positions all vertices. We have evaluated our layout on several well-known data sets.

Recent approaches thus aim at finding a sparser representation of the graph to amplify variations in pairwise distances. Since the effect of sparsification on the layout is difficult to describe analytically, the incorporated filtering parameters of these approaches typically have to be selected manually and individually for each input instance. We here propose the use of graph invariants to determine suitable parameters automatically. This allows us to perform adaptive filtering to obtain drawings in which the cluster structure is most prominent. The approach is based on an empirical relationship between input and output characteristics that is derived from real and synthetic networks. Experimental evaluation shows the effectiveness of our approach and suggests that it can be used by default to increase the robustness of force-directed layout methods."

Two time series data-flow visualization approaches at both local and global scales are proposed respectively: a stream model focuses on data flows within the local area while a hub model addresses the relations between groups of nodes across the graph. The computational complexity and quantitative performance analysis on three different datasets were conducted to examine the scalability of the visualization model. The simulation results show that the central algorithms in our approach are able to achieve acceptable performance in real world test cases.

Many current VR systems are noncollaborative, while data analysis and visualization is often a multi-person process. Our goal in this paper is to address the technical and user experience challenges that arise when creating VR environments for collaborative data visualization. We focus on the integration of multiple tracking systems and the new interaction paradigms that this integration can enable, along with visual design considerations that apply specifically to collaborative network visualization in virtual reality. We demonstrate a system for collaborative interaction with large 3D layouts of Twitter friend/follow networks. The system is built by combining a 'Holojam' architecture (multiple GearVR Headsets within an OptiTrack motion capture stage) and Perception Neuron motion suits, to offer an untethered, full-room multi-person visualization experience."

However, there has been a recent surge in popularity of consumer grade 3D displays and immersive head-mounted displays (HMDs). The ubiquity of such displays enables the possibility of immersive, stereoscopic visualization environments. While techniques that utilize such immersive environments have been explored extensively for spatial and scientific visualizations, contrastingly very little has been explored for information visualization. In this paper, we present our considerations of layout, rendering, and interaction methods for visualizing graphs in an immersive environment. We conducted a user study to evaluate our techniques compared to traditional 2D graph visualization. The results show that participants answered significantly faster with a fewer number of interactions using our techniques, especially for more difficult tasks. While the overall correctness rates are not significantly different, we found that participants gave significantly more correct answers using our techniques for larger graphs."

A natural approach, called 'time-to-time mapping', consists of computing a representation of the network at each time step and animating the transition between subsequent time steps. However, recent literature recommends to represent time-related events by means of static graphic counterparts, realizing the so called 'time-to-space mapping'. This paradigm has been successfully applied to networks where nodes and edges are subject to a restricted set of events: appearances, disappearances, and attribute changes. In this paper we describe NetFork, a system that conveys the timings and the impact of path changes that occur in a routing network by suitable time-to-space metaphors, without relying on the time-to-time mapping adopted by the play-back interfaces of alternative network monitoring tools.

Respondentsxe2x80x99 task was to find particular point symbol on the map as fast as possible. Scanpath comparison is one group of the eye-tracking data analyses methods used for revealing the strategy of the respondents. In cartographic studies, the most commonly used application for scanpath comparison is eyePatterns that output is hierarchical clustering and a tree graph representing the relationships between analysed sequences. During an analysis of the algorithm generating a tree graph, it was found that the outputs do not correspond to the reality. We proceeded to the creation of a new tool called ScanGraph. This tool uses visualization of cliques in simple graphs and is freely available at www.eyetracking.upol.cz/scangraph . Results of the study proved the functionality of the tool and its suitability for analyses of different strategies of map readers. Based on the results of the tool, similar scanpaths were selected, and groups of respondents with similar strategies were identified.

Biedl,"In this dissertation, we study automated graph visualization in the orthogonal style. Our core idea is to break the problem of generating an orthogonal drawing into three phases: first placing the nodes as points, then approximately routing the edges, and finally converting nodes to boxes and assigning edges to ports at nodes. With different implementations of the phases, this scheme yields a wide range of results. We obtain drawings which improve on previously known results in terms of the area and the number of bends, and study drawings of planar graphs and of complete graphs.n Breaking the drawing generation into three phases results in a highly flexible algorithm, which permits to add various additional requirements, such as constraints on the placement of nodes, the size of nodes, and the assignment of ports.n This study of orthogonal visualization algorithms was initiated by the need to add an orthogonal library to a commercially available layout toolkit, and major parts of this thesis have been implemented as part of this toolkit."

Improving the understanding of the complicated cellular mechanisms underlying metastasis requires investigations of the signaling pathways. To this end, we developed a METastasis (MET) network visualization and curation tool to assist metastasis researchers retrieve network information of interest while browsing through the large volume of studies in PubMed. MET can recognize relations among genes, cancers, tissues and organs of metastasis mentioned in the literature through text-mining techniques, and then produce a visualization of all mined relations in a metastasis network. To facilitate the curation process, MET is developed as a browser extension that allows curators to review and edit concepts and relations related to metastasis directly in PubMed. PubMed users can also view the metastatic networks integrated from the large collection of research papers directly through MET. For the BioCreative 2015 interactive track (IAT), a curation task was proposed to curate metastatic networks among PubMed abstracts.

As we learn, a concept-map or a node-link diagram can enhance the learning ability of learners from beginner to advanced user level, so RDF graph visualization can be a suitable tool for making users be familiar with Semantic technology. However, an RDF graph generated from the whole query result is not suitable for reading, because it is highly connected like a hairball and less organized. To make a graph presenting knowledge be more proper to read, this research introduces an approach to sparsify a graph using the combination of three main functions: graph simplification, triple ranking, and property selection. These functions are mostly initiated based on the interpretation of RDF data as knowledge units together with statistical analysis in order to deliver an easily-readable graph to users. A prototype is implemented to demonstrate the suitability and feasibility of the approach. It shows that the simple and flexible graph visualization is easy to read, and it creates the impression of users. In addition, the attractive tool helps to inspire users to realize the advantageous role of linked data in knowledge management."

In this paper, we leveraged the block information on the Region Of Interest (ROI) based brain networks and studied the problem of blockwise brain network visual comparison. An integrated visual analytics framework was proposed. In the first stage, a two-level ROI block hierarchy was detected by optimizing the anatomical structure and the predictive comparison performance simultaneously. In the second stage, the NodeTrix representation was adopted and customized to visualize the brain network with block information. We conducted controlled user experiments and case studies to evaluate our proposed solution. Results indicated that our visual analytics method outperformed the commonly used node-link graph and adjacency matrix design in the blockwise network comparison tasks.

Edge-bundling techniques are designed to reduce edge clutter in node-link diagrams by coalescing lines into common paths or bundles. Unfortunately, traditional bundling techniques introduce ambiguity since edges are only bundled by spatial proximity , rather than network connectivity ; following an edge from its source to its target can lead to the perception of incorrect connectivity if edges are not clearly separated within the bundles. Contrary, CDs bundle edges based on common sources or targets. Thus, a smooth path along a confluent bundle indicates precise connectivity. While CDs have been described in theory, practical investigation and application to real-world networks (i.e., networks beyond those with certain planarity restrictions) is currently lacking. Here, we provide the first algorithm for constructing CDs from arbitrary directed and undirected networks and present a simple layout method, embedded in a sand box environment providing techniques for interactive exploration. We then investigate patterns and artifacts in CDs, which we compare to other common edge-bundling techniques. Finally, we present the first user study that compares edge-compression techniques, including CD, power graphs, metro-style, and common edge bundling. We found that users without particular expertise in visualization or network analysis are able to read small CDs without difficulty. Compared to existing bundling techniques, CDs are more likely to allow people to correctly perceive connectivity."

To further visually enhance the time-varying graph structures we add user-adaptable isolines to the resulting dynamic graph representation. The computed visual encoding of the dynamic graph is aesthetically appealing due to its smooth curves and can additionally be used to do comparisons in a long graph sequence, i.e., from an information visualization perspective it serves as an overview representation supporting to start more detailed analyses processes.

This dissertation work attempts to address both of these issues, by providing and evaluating scalable and useful interaction methods for graph visualization systems. Our work mainly focuses on what we call manipulation methods, which are a set of interaction methods that enable the user to interactively manipulate the layout of a node-link graph. We provide a survey of existing interaction methods and introduce our own methods. Methods range from more specialized techniques, such as for an interactive visual recommender system, to more general procedures, which can be applied to any node-link data.

The use of visualization techniques to make sense of large volumes of information is an essential ingredient, especially for the analysis of complex interrelated data, which are represented as graphs. The growing availability of powerful and inexpensive cloud computing services naturally motivates the study of distributed graph visualization algorithms, able to scale to the size of large graphs. We study the problem of designing a distributed visualization algorithm that must be simple to implement and whose computing infrastructure does not require major hardware or software investments. We design, implement, and experiment a force-directed algorithm in Giraph, a popular open source framework for distributed computing, based on a vertex-centric design paradigm. The algorithm is tested both on real and artificial graphs with up to one million edges. The experiments show the scalability and effectiveness of our technique when compared to a centralized implementation of the same force-directed model. Graphs with about one million edges can be drawn in a few minutes, by spending about 1 USD per drawing with a cloud computing infrastructure of Amazon."

The network is created by calculating pairwise correlations through all pairs of variables, whether they be numerical, ordinal or nominal. We subsequently construct the network over the entire set of variables, clustering variables with similar effects to discover group relationships between the various biomedical characteristics. We use a semi-automatic procedure that makes the selection of all pairs possible and discuss issues of dealing with different types of variables. This is done either by limiting the analysis to numerical and ordinal ones, or by binning their values into intervals of values. Knowledge extracted from the data in this mode can be used to select variables for statistical models, or as markers of medically interesting conditions."

Russell, Malcolm Slaney","Understanding networks of people linked by some common factor is an important task in many domains. Most commonly, a user creates a visuali- zation of social interactions to see the patterns of interactions between indi- viduals, and then used to find and identify important groups. Networks of indi- viduals and links between them form graphs that vary with time and impor- tance. Visualizing the changes in social networks over time is a non-trivial de- sign task, imposing interesting demands on the visualization and interaction model. In this paper we briefly analyze the user requirements for interactive visualizations of streaming social network data. We find that these continu- ously updated, dynamic displays need: (1) controls that permit time-based con- trol of the visualization, including pausing, restarting and variable speed play- back of the data, (2) the ability to continue importing and processing streamed information even the display is paused, (3) a visually represented method to track changes in the displays over time, (4) interaction methods to allow drill- down from the visualization to original source data, and (5) information extrac- tion from the displayed social network. We describe our visualization tool, SSNV, showing how it embodies these interaction requirements."

However, all of the citation network data are displayed in a full view that is limited to the cartesian coordinates system. This will make citation network be more complex when the number of citation network data to be visualized increases. A complex citation network will make it difficult to users to get focus on data or specific part of the citation network.

Panning techniques used to deal with these problems are direct repositioning (grab and drag), navigation window, and cartesian distortion. Users can perform panning in all directions (freeform panning) with the three of panning techniques.

The tasks of thisn analysis include but not limited to: understanding of (legacy) software, checking guidelines,n improving product lines, finding structure, or re-engineering of existing software. Graphs withn multi-type edges are possible representation for these relations considering them as edges, whilen nodes represent classes and interfaces of software. Then, this multiple type edges graph cann be mapped to visualizations. However, the visualizations should deal with the multiplicity ofn relations types and scalability, and they should enable the software engineers to recognize visualn patterns at the same time.n To advance the usage of visualizations for analyzing the static structure of software systems,n I tracked difierent development phases of the interactive multi-matrix visualization (IMMV)n showing an extended user study at the end. Visual structures were determined and classifiedn systematically using IMMV compared to PNLV in the extended user study as four categories:n High degree, Within-package edges, Cross-package edges, No edges. In addition to these structuresn that were found in these handy tools, other structures that look interesting for softwaren engineers such as cycles and hierarchical structures need additional visualizations to displayn them and to investigate them. Therefore, an extended approach for graph layout was presentedn that improves the quality of the decomposition and the drawing of directed graphsn according to their topology based on rigorous definitions. The extension involves describingn and analyzing the algorithms for decomposition and drawing in detail giving polynomial timen complexity and space complexity. Finally, I handled visualizing graphs with multi-type edgesn using small-multiples, where each tile is dedicated to one edge-type utilizing the topologicaln graph layout to highlight non-trivial cycles, trees, and DAGs for showing and analyzing then static structure of software. Finally, I applied this approach to four software systems to shown its usefulness."

Recent studies have suggested that phylogenetic network approach may shed some lights on our understanding of multi-tissue transcriptome evolution; yet the underlying evolutionary mechanism remains unclear. In this paper we develop a Brownian-based model of transcriptome evolution under the phylogenetic network that can statistically distinguish between the patterns of species-clustering and tissue-clustering. Our model can be used as a null hypothesis (neutral transcriptome evolution) for testing any correlation in tissue evolution, can be applied to cancer transcriptome evolution to study whether two tumors of an individual appeared independently or via metastasis, and can be useful to detect convergent evolution at the transcriptional level."

The value is first addressed with an analysis of network visualisation process called 'Ostinato', an operational context in relation to cognitive fit as a theoretical context. Then, value is explored with an analysis using taxonomy of interactive dynamics for visual analytics. Furthermore, evaluating the usability of visualisation is conducted in the context of the Parisian ecosystem, with board members using network visualisations to explore complex multi-layered knowledge about relationships among key executives, companies and financing organisations. All findings support the argument that value of knowledge assets in problem-solving performance depends on both format of the data and nature of the task. Furthermore, the findings support the importance of continual involvement and interaction between data analysts and decision-makers; they highlight the importance of considering knowledge assets as value drivers that can support knowledge-based innovation."

One interesting way of reducing this clutter is to use partial edges when there are visual elements (edge and curve) crossings. This paper empirically evaluates the use of partial edges for a small-scaled Euler diagrams with graphs and tests whether Euler diagrams with partial edges are readable and interpretable. In this study, twenty participants were presented with eighteen manually drawn diagrams using a software which recorded the answers and the time taken to answer each question. The results indicate that there is no significant difference between diagrams having partial and non-partial edges in terms of accuracy and time (performance analysis) but users preferred partial edges to be aesthetically pleasing in terms of reading graphs in Euler diagrams and layout features (preference analysis), which means partial edges can be used as a strategy to avoid clutter. The results obtained from the task performance and preference will be useful in generating real small-world graphs in an optimal way. The paper concludes that partial edges in a graph does not significantly affect comprehension and as a further direction, our existing Euler diagrams with complete graphs (full edges) tool will be extended to partial edges and evaluated."

This algorithm can provide beautiful visualizations for small to medium graphs, but when it comes to larger graphs it fails to keep some independent nodes or even subgraphs inside the visualization space.

These capabilities provide some essential capabilities for social networking analysis. Take the following for example: general users chat with others through instant messaging on social networks. Or perhaps, they would rather start up a discussion with other users. However, discussions of this kind that share similar interests can allow users to get to know others and improve interpersonal relationships. Afterwards, they can know their friends more about what they like and what dislike.

Selecting a xe2x80x9cgoodxe2x80x9d layout method is thus important for visualizing a graph. The selection can be highly subjective and dependent on the given task. A common approach to selecting a good layout is to use aesthetic criteria and visual inspection. However, fully calculating various layouts and their associated aesthetic metrics is computationally expensive. In this paper, we present a machine learning approach to large graph visualization based on computing the topological similarity of graphs using graph kernels. For a given graph, our approach can show what the graph would look like in different layouts and estimate their corresponding aesthetic metrics. An important contribution of our work is the development of a new framework to design graph kernels. Our experimental study shows that our estimation calculation is considerably faster than computing the actual layouts and their aesthetic metrics. Also, our graph kernels outperform the state-of-the-art ones in both time and accuracy. In addition, we conducted a user study to demonstrate that the topological similarity computed with our graph kernel matches perceptual similarity assessed by human users."

This particular graph topology focuses on node structure and gives strength to weak edges. At this occasion, we unveil the Singularity Threshold, giving an opportunity to isolate structure from singular parts of melodies. Where usual Pitch constellations focus on chords, we focus on successive pitch intervals. On the second part, we propose a rhythm representation using a Force-Directed layout. In addition to structural information, our second technique shows proximal and peripheral elements. This experiment features 6 melodies that we propose to visualize using Gephi."

The k-core of a graph is also known as the degeneracy in graph theory, and can be computed in linear time. Our k-core based multi-level algorithm also includes a new concentric circle placement and a variation of force-directed layout to display the structure of graphs effectively. Experiments with real-world networks suggest that our algorithm performs well for visualization of large and complex scale-free networks, with a power-law degree distribution, a short diameter and a high clustering coefficient. Comparison with other multi-level algorithms shows that our method is fast and effective, in particular performs better than Walshaw [26] and FM3 [15]."

In addition to presenting network structure at each time step, the layout sequence should preserve user's mental map.

An evolution parameter, considering time-space changes in the dynamic process, is presented to restrain nodes' movement and preserve mental map. An energy parameter is then applied based on nodes' energy state to achieve a stable and aesthetic layout.

Hogan, Xin-Yi Chua, Margot Brereton, Daniel Johnson, Markus Rittenbruch","Over the last decade, the development of a range of Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) technologies has led to an enormous increase in the size of the data sets available in molecular biology. The scale of these data presents new challenges for researchers, and visualisation is widely regarded as an essential tool for exploration and detailed analysis of candidate relationships. Inevitably, there are cognitive and technical limits on the information which may usefully be displayed on a particular device, and there may be some tension between the analytical utility of a representation and its coverage of the relationships available within the data. Careful attention must be given to the overall design of the visualisation, and to the channels selected, and these tasks are further complicated if the intent is to support interactive exploration by a number of collocated researchers or inclusion within a collaborative workflow. This paper is concerned with the design of a visualisation for regulatory interactions in bacteria, the complex relationships that exist between a set of proteins and the much larger set of genes whose action they control. Modelling these interactions yields equally complex network diagrams, and even classical hairball representations when visualised. In this work we explore the iterative refinement of an alternative visualisation for data of this kind, moving away from the traditional hairball to a 'field' of smaller structures, the intent being to support effective comparison across many dozens of strains and species rather than the exhaustive documentation of a full set of interactions for the one organism. While the study did not directly compare insights obtained using TRNDiff with those obtained using other tools, formal evaluations have allowed us to settle on an effective set of representations and visual channels, and interactive features to support analysis. Our approach has produced a far more effective visualisation of these important data sets, and offers useful lessons for tool developers and insights into the utility of touch devices and larger displays for visual analytics and generation of insight at scale."
2770289653,21698,Dynamic Graph Visualization on Different Temporal Granularities,2017-07-01,24,2,,,2017,,"Michael Burch, Thomas Reinhardt","Dynamic graphs are typically represented in a time-to-space mapping with the goal to preserve the mental map in order to reduce cognitive efforts for comparison tasks. Such a mapping from time to space has the general drawback that space limitations are sooner reached than in corresponding time-to-time mappings to which graph animation belongs. Consequently, to get an overview about the dynamics in a graph sequence, space-efficient and compact visual encodings are used to show as many graphs in the sequence as possible. Temporal graph aggregation is hence a clever data transformation strategy, but negatively, it does not provide an overview about individual graphs nor does it show graph subsequences on finer time granularities. In this paper we describe a visualization technique that can visualize dynamic graphs in a time-to-space mapping and additionally, allows the graph analyst to interactively explore the dynamic graph data on different temporal granularities. Moreover, if the dynamic graph data is rather dense, it can be filtered by selecting density intervals. We illustrate the usefulness of our visualization tool by applying it to a dynamic graph dataset that simulates time-contiuously changing graphs."

In DJs, variables are described by variable labels (VLs), which are the names/meanings of variables. In the previous study, the matrix-based method for inferring VLs in DJs whose VLs are unknown, using the texts in outlines of DJs was proposed. However, the previous method showed only the list of VLs with the similarity scores to queries. Moreover, the relationships among VLs were not displayed in the lists, which was difficult for users to understand the connections of VLs. In this paper, we propose VARIABLE QUEST which is the network visualization system of VLs using the matrix-based inferring method of VLs by unifying co-occurrence graphs. VARIABLE QUEST represents the co-occurrence and the frequency between VLs in DJs. The co-occurrence of VLs is a feature that there may be a highly frequent pair of VLs appearing at the same time in data, e.g., latitude and longitude, or weather and temperature. The network visualization unifying co-occurrence graphs may not only support those who want to obtain new data in the Market of Data but also function as a tool for aiding the design of experiments of the researchers."

One of the solutions for this problem is combing between one of the Association rules visualization method and generalization method. Association rules visualization method is graph-based method. Generalization method is Attribute Oriented Induction algorithm ( AOI ). AOI after combing calls Modified AOI because it removes and changes in the steps of the traditional AOI. The graph technique after combing also calls grouped graph method because it displays the aggregated that results rules from AOI. The results of this paper are ratio of compression that gives clarity of visualization. These results provide the ability for test and drill down in the rules or understand and roll up.

Customer expectation is an important factor in succeeding in service, because the expectation depends on service evaluation. Therefore, to develop a service by co-creation, the service provider needs the customer expectation. To extract customer expectation, we first extract a co-occurrence network called collective intelligence expectation network from Web texts about a target service. From this network, we aggregate the personalized expectation acquired from questionnaire and generate a customer expectation network."

The data model structure associated with bipartite graphs suggests a spatial distribution consists of two groups of elements separated physically but linked by relations. This article presents a quick review of some of the most common methods of bipartite graphs visualization and shows some simple alternatives to implement these methods. In addition, a new method for bipartite graphs visualization, called Sierra, is proposed. This method allows a quick and simple determination of the degree (number of links) of each node in the graph. Also, the method facilitates the identification of grouping between elements as the relationships that could exist between independent groups."

The proposed framework aims to help better understand spatiotemporal patterns of human dynamics and social interactions over both physical and virtual spaces simultaneously, as well as explore how emerging events trigger spatial-temporal-social interactions and information diffusion from a process perspective. As a proof of concept, we demonstrate the proposed framework with a case study using geotagged tweets and associated visualization in the ArcScene software. We hope that this research can stimulate new insights on integrating multidisciplinary knowledge to explore human dynamics in a broader way."

To visualize these networks and communicate them in publications, biologists must manually position the nodes and edges of each network to reflect their real-world physical structure. This process does not scale well, and graph layout algorithms lack the biological underpinnings to offer a viable alternative. In this paper, we present CrowdLayout, a crowdsourcing system that leverages human intelligence and creativity to design layouts of biological network visualizations. CrowdLayout provides design guidelines, abstractions, and editing tools to help novice workers perform like experts. We evaluated CrowdLayout in two experiments with paid crowd workers and real biological network data, finding that crowds could both create and evaluate meaningful, high-quality layouts. We also discuss implications for crowdsourced design and network visualizations in other domains."

In this paper, we introduce a novel, scalable, treetable multivariate graph visualization technique, which makes many tasks related to multivariate graph analysis easier to achieve. The core principle we follow is to selectively query for nodes or subgraphs of interest and visualize these subgraphs as a spanning tree of the graph. The tree is laid out in a linear layout, which enables us to juxtapose the nodes with a table visualization where diverse attributes can be shown. We also use this table as an adjacency matrix, so that the resulting technique is a hybrid node-link/adjacency matrix technique. We implement this concept in Juniper, and complement it with a set of interaction techniques that enable analysts to dynamically grow, re-structure, and aggregate the tree, as well as change the layout or show paths between nodes. We demonstrate the utility of our tool in usage scenarios for different multivariate networks: a bipartite network of scholars, papers, and citation metrics, and a multitype network of story characters, places, books, etc."

However, these learned features are hard to identify and interpret from a human vision perspective, causing a lack of understanding of the CNNs internal working mechanism. To improve the CNN interpretability, the CNN visualization is well utilized as a qualitative analysis method, which translates the internal features into visually perceptible patterns. And many CNN visualization works have been proposed in the literature to interpret the CNN in perspectives of network structure, operation, and semantic concept. In this paper, we expect to provide a comprehensive survey of several representative CNN visualization methods, including Activation Maximization, Network Inversion, Deconvolutional Neural Networks (DeconvNet), and Network Dissection based visualization. These methods are presented in terms of motivations, algorithms, and experiment results. Based on these visualization methods, we also discuss their practical applications to demonstrate the significance of the CNN interpretability in areas of network design, optimization, security enhancement, etc."

Network visualizations are a frequently used class of visualizations across domains to explore entities and relationships between them. However, little work has been done in exploring the design of network visualizations and corresponding interactive tasks such as selection, browsing, and navigation on touch-based displays. Network visualizations on touch-based displays are usually implemented by porting the conventional pointer based interactions as-is to a touch environment and replacing the mouse cursor with a finger. However, this approach does not fully utilize the potential of naturalistic multi-touch gestures afforded by touch displays. We present a set of single hand, multi-touch gestures for interactive exploration of network visualizations and employ these in a prototype system, Tangraphe.

Graphs are often visualized into node-link diagrams for better understanding of them. Traditionally, graphs are visualized to meet some pre-defined quality metrics, or aesthetics. It is commonly agreed that graphs that are drawn based on aesthetics are more likely to be not only beautiful but also comprehensible. However, those aesthetics were originally proposed by researchers based on their intuitions from a designerxe2x80x99s perspective. Although some of them have been empirically validated, to produce truly user cognitively friendly visualizations,well-grounded cognitive theories and design guidelines are needed. In this paper, we attempt to explore a cognitive approach that follows a user-centered process in visualizing graphs. We begin by proposing a graph visualization model, which is further conceptualized into a two-stage assessment cycle. It is argued that to provide effective cognitive support, it is essential to understand the cognitive process of a particular task in association with the attributes of the end user and the visual representation, and that to develop a set of design principles, what cognitive processes or graph reading strategies are involved should be part of evaluation. We materialized the model by reviewing the literature and providing relevant examples in the context of providing cognitive support and understanding cognitive process. We introduce theories from other disciplines such as perceptual and cognitive psychology, summarize methodologies that have been used in prior research, and discuss their implications for producing user-centered visualizations."

Hierarchical structure of network is extracted in data preprocessing stage, which can help to find the minimum subnets with topological changes. Multi-constraint force directed algorithm is applied to changed subnets. Evolution parameter is used to restrain the movement of existing nodes to be consistent with their previous positions. Energy parameter, on the other hand, is used to get rid of the constrain of previous position and achieve aesthetic layout. After rearrange all changed subnets, A time-varying stress model is introduced to adjust the position of all other subnets from bottom to top, which can avoid recalculating new positions for all nodes and thus improve efficiency."

To combine multiple visualization technologies reasonably, the system provides information from three levels. It also uses unsupervised learning methods to detect anomalies in different ways.

The real-time visualization of graphs with millions of edges is a challenge but is necessary to grasp information hidden in huge datasets. This article presents an end-to-end technique to visualize huge graphs using an established Big Data ecosystem and a lightweight client running in a Web browser. For that purpose, levels of abstraction and graph tiles are generated by a batch layer and the interactive visualization is provided using a serving layer and client-side real-time computation of edge bundling and graph splatting. A major challenge is to create techniques that work without moving data to an ad hoc system and that take advantage of the horizontal scalability of these infrastructures. We introduce two novel scalable algorithms that enable to generate a canopy clustering and to aggregate graph edges. These two algorithms are both used to produce levels of abstraction and graph tiles. We prove that our technique guarantee a quality of visualization by controlling both the necessary bandwidth required for data transfer and the quality of the produced visualization. Furthermore, we demonstrate the usability of our technique by providing a complete prototype. We present benchmarks on graphs with millions of elements and we compare our results to those obtained by state of the art techniques. Our results show that new Big Data technologies can be incorporated into visualization pipeline to push out the size limits of graphs one can visually analyze."

It helps to find features of the network that are not easily identifiable. Graph data visualization tries to enable users to grasp difficult concepts or identify new patterns. One of the problems that prevents users from achieving this goal is the crossing number of a graph drawing. A crossing in graph data visualization is a point where two curves intersect. In the minimum crossing number problem, the goal is to find a drawing of G with minimum number of edge crossings. In particular, except for a few initial cases, the crossing number of graphs remains unknown. Circular layout is one of the graph drawing algorithms that is used for visualizing graph datasets. In this research we tried to minimize the number of edge crossings in a circular layout using genetic algorithm. The result is promising."

With the growth of network science research across a variety of domains, there is an increased call for basic literacies in networks and the ability to use network visualization as a powerful tool to understand interactions in complex systems. In this chapter, we discuss the current status of the research on network visualization literacy (NVL), how it is measured, what the current research says about NVL across a variety of contexts, ways experts are teaching to develop NVL, and recommendations based on our current understanding of best ways to improve NVL."

In the field of Biology, data visualization is used to better understand processes that range from phylogenetic trees to multiple layers of molecular networks. The latter is especially challenging due to the large quantities of varying elements and complex relationships, often with no perceptible structure. Although various tools have been proposed to improve the visualization of molecular networks, many challenges still persist. In this paper, we propose a tool that uses interactive visualization models to represent the dynamic behaviors of molecular networks. The tool employs various methods to explore and organize the data, including clustering, force-directed layouts, and a timeline for navigating through time-series data. To further analyze temporal attributes, the timeline can be distorted through a force-directed layout to spatially position time points according to their similarity. Additionally, gene expression can be annotated through an integrated biological database. The visualization model was validated with the use of time-series gene expression RNA-Seq data from the HIV-1 infection."

By rotating the imaging tank in between measurements, multiple projections can be obtained, providing a 3D image of the breast after reconstruction by means of a filtered backprojection. So far, breasts of healthy volunteers were imaged. Three-dimensional images of the breast contour, the nipple and blood vessel networks within the breast could be observed with high contrast and unprecedented detail."

Several methods have focused in network representation at node/edge or substructure level. However, many real life challenges such as time-varying, multilayer, chemical compounds and brain networks involve analysis of a family of graphs instead of single one opening additional challenges in graph comparison and representation. Traditional approaches for learning representations relies on hand-crafting specialized heuristics to extract meaningful information about the graphs, e.g statistical properties, structural features, etc. as well as engineered graph distances to quantify dissimilarity between networks. In this work we provide an unsupervised approach to learn embedding representation for a collection of graphs so that it can be used in numerous graph mining tasks. By using an unsupervised neural network approach on input graphs, we aim to capture the underlying distribution of the data in order to discriminate between different class of networks. Our method is assessed empirically on synthetic and real life datasets and evaluated in three different tasks: graph clustering, visualization and classification. Results reveal that our method outperforms well known graph distances and graph-kernels in clustering and classification tasks, being highly efficient in runtime."

The main challenges include how to summarize large-scale, complex, and time-evolving influence graphs, and how to design effective visual metaphors and dynamic representation methods to illustrate influence patterns over time. In this work, we present Eiffel, an integrated visual analytics system that applies triple summarizations on evolutionary influence graphs in the nodal, relational, and temporal dimensions. In numerical experiments, Eiffel summarization results outperformed those of traditional clustering algorithms with respect to the influence-flow-based objective. Moreover, a flow map representation is proposed and adapted to the case of influence graph summarization, which supports two modes of evolutionary visualization (i.e., flip-book and movie) to expedite the analysis of influence graph dynamics. We conducted two controlled user experiments to evaluate our technique on influence graph summarization and visualization respectively.

Unfortunately, such visualizations can inadvertently expose the ostensibly private identities of the persons that make up the dataset. By purposely violating graph readability metrics for a small region of the graph, we conjecture that local, exposed privacy leaks may be perceptually masked from easy recognition. In particular, we consider three commonly known metricsxe2x80x94edge crossing, node clustering, and node-edge overlappingxe2x80x94as a strategy to hide leaks. We evaluate the effectiveness of violating these metrics by conducting a user study that measures subject performance at visually searching for and identifying a privacy leak.

We suggest future directions on how perceptual masking can be a viable strategy, primarily where modifying the underlying network structure is unfeasible."

This semantic interpretation method minimizes network learning in the system as a fixed network topology only exists as a guideline to help users understand. Furthermore, it does not need to discover every single node to understand the characteristics of each clustering within the network. After extracting and analyzing the sentiment words from the movie review data, we designed a movie network based on the similarities between the words. The network formed in this way will appear as a multilevel sentiment network visualization after the following three steps: (1) design a heatmap visualization to effectively discover the main emotions on each movie review; (2) create a two-dimensional multidimensional scaling (MDS) map of semantic word data to facilitate semantic understanding of network and then fix the movie network topology on the map; (3) create an asterism graphic with emotions to allow users to easily interpret node groups with similar sentiment words. The research also presents a virtual scenario about how our network visualization can be used as a movie recommendation system. We next evaluated our progress to determine whether it would improve user cognition for multilevel analysis experience compared to the existing network system. Results showed that our method provided improved user experience in terms of cognition. Thus, it is appropriate as an alternative method for semantic understanding."

With this in mind, we propose the Zoomable Multi-Level Tree (ZMLT) algorithm for multi-level tree-based, map-like visualization of large graphs. We propose seven desirable properties that such visualization should maintain and an algorithm that accomplishes them. (1) The abstract trees represent the underlying graph appropriately at different level of details; (2) The embedded trees represent the underlying graph appropriately at different levels of details; (3) At every level of detail we show real vertices and real paths from the underlying graph; (4) If any node or edge appears in a given level, then they also appear in all deeper levels; (5) All nodes at the current level and higher levels are labeled and there are no label overlaps; (6) There are no edge crossings on any level; (7) The drawing area is proportional to the total area of the labels. This algorithm is implemented and we have a functional prototype for the interactive interface in a web browser. A recent data visualization literacy study shows that most people cannot read networks that use hierarchical cluster representations such as super-noding and edge bundling. Other studies that compare standard node-link representations with map-like visualizations show that map-like visualizations are superior in terms of task performance, memorization and engagement. With this in mind, we propose the Zoomable Multilevel Tree (ZMLT) algorithm for map-like visualization of large graphs that is representative, real, persistent, overlap-free labeled, planar, and compact. These six desirable properties are formalized with the following guarantees: (1) The abstract and embedded trees represent the underlying graph appropriately at different level of details (in terms of the structure of the graph as well as the embedding thereof); (2) At every level of detail we show real vertices and real paths from the underlying graph; (3) If any node or edge appears in a given level, then they also appear in all deeper levels; (4) All nodes at the current level and higher levels are labeled and there are no label overlaps; (5) There are no crossings on any level; (6) The drawing area is proportional to the total area of the labels.

However, in many application fields such as the social sciences (social networks), biology (protein interaction models), software engineering (program call graphs), connectivity and topology information is intertwined with group, clustering, and hierarchical information. Several recent visualization techniques, such as BubbleSets, LineSets and GMap, make explicit use of grouping and clustering, but evaluating such visualization has been difficult due to the lack of standardized group-level tasks. With this in mind, our goal is to define a new set of tasks that assess group-level comprehension. We propose several types of group-level tasks and provide several examples of each type. Finally, we characterize some of the proposed tasks using the multi-level typology of abstract visualization tasks. We believe that adding group-level tasks to the task taxonomy for graph visualization would make the taxonomy more useful for the recent graph visualization techniques. It would help evaluators define and categorize new tasks, and it would help generalize individual results collected in controlled experiments."

Thematically it focuses on the contexts of problems in urban design and places community spaces at the heart of urban design research. The book provides practicable tools for network modelling and visualization in urban design research. Step-by-step examples take readers through methods for tracing the evolution of road networks, and their impacts on contemporary community spaces. Easy-to-follow guides to programming show how to process and plot community data sets as network graphs. They reveal how these can help to observe and represent the different ways in which community spaces are inter-connected. This book places these technological methods in the context of current theories of community formations. It considers how these cutting-edge tools for thinking in urban design research – comprising both theories and methods – could transform our understanding of community spaces as being complex, inter-dependent and socially meaningful assets. This book is pioneering in its analysis of the urban contexts to community formations, and in its argument for professional integration between urban and knowledge practitioners. Academics and professionals within the fields of design research, urban studies, spatial analysis, urban geography and sociology will benefit from reading this book."

However, these learned features are hard to identify and interpret from a human vision perspective, causing a lack of understanding of the CNNs' internal working mechanism. To improve the CNN interpretability, the CNN visualization is well utilized as a qualitative analysis method, which translates the internal features into visually perceptible patterns. And many CNN visualization works have been proposed in the literature to interpret the CNN in perspectives of network structure, operation, and semantic concept. In this paper, we expect to provide a comprehensive survey of several representative CNN visualization methods, including Activation Maximization, Network Inversion, Deconvolutional Neural Networks (DeconvNet), and Network Dissection based visualization. These methods are presented in terms of motivations, algorithms, and experiment results. Based on these visualization methods, we also discuss their practical applications to demonstrate the significance of the CNN interpretability in areas of network design, optimization, security enhancement, etc."

In this paper, we introduce a novel, scalable, tree-table multivariate graph visualization technique, which makes many tasks related to multivariate graph analysis easier to achieve. The core principle we follow is to selectively query for nodes or subgraphs of interest and visualize these subgraphs as a spanning tree of the graph. The tree is laid out linearly, which enables us to juxtapose the nodes with a table visualization where diverse attributes can be shown. We also use this table as an adjacency matrix, so that the resulting technique is a hybrid node-link/adjacency matrix technique. We implement this concept in Juniper and complement it with a set of interaction techniques that enable analysts to dynamically grow, restructure, and aggregate the tree, as well as change the layout or show paths between nodes. We demonstrate the utility of our tool in usage scenarios for different multivariate networks: a bipartite network of scholars, papers, and citation metrics and a multitype network of story characters, places, books, etc."

International journal of tv serial narratives,Giulia Taurino,"With the advent of open-source digital tools, abstract models have been consistently adopted in humanistic research and they have proven to be useful for many purposes: for predictive and descriptive analysis using quantitative or qualitative models, for database management, as in the case of relational models, and for modeling cultural dynamics (Gabor 2008). Among others, television scholars embraced such a trend in cultural analytics and digital humanities, by notably adopting modeling practices for assessing viewers behaviors (Wonneberger 2009) or for measuring qualitative variations in narrative ecosystems (Pescatore, Rocchi 2018). Drawing upon this digital turn, the following paper aims to discuss the advantages, challenges and limits of adopting visual models for the analysis of large corpora in television studies. Examples of data visualization will be notably shown here, in application to a sample database of anthology TV series extracted through the Wikidata Query Service.

The study uncovered 6 classes of insights from game developers: thinking in networks, insights on data consistency, accessibility and usability, visualisation preferences, exploring related games, and data contributions from the community. The study is limited by the data sources available about design influences, acknowledging that idea networks are only a partial representation of the full picture, which cannot be known.

The proposed approach allows decreasing semantic noise in SLN overview and navigation and also simplifies the process of understanding the domain studied with SLN by means of semantic zooming. We proposed priori importance levels of SLN items and semantic zooming scale to visualize the SLN with different details level. We designed an interactive SLN visualization process including the following SLN transformations: filtering SLN items, context collapse and expansion for SLN item, and changing the details in the visualized object representation in the geometric SLN graph. The transformation algorithms were developed, and also examples of SNL semantic zooming were described in details in the paper."

In this data pool of more than 171 million items we perform work clustering. By offering an aggregated view of alln publications representing a work, e.g. different editions and translations, the collection appears much more structured and searching is easier.n In this paper we would like to show the use of graph visualization for display, analysis and evaluationn of work clusters. Graph visualization enables users to obtain a more transparent view of the connections underlying the structure of a work cluster. Work clustering is achieved by creating and matching keys which combine different metadata elements of a bibliographic record. Applying a breadth-first search, publications with identical matchkeys are grouped together. We use different keys to represent a publication, so each publication can obtain more than one key. Thus, one matchkey establishes a connection between publications. If one of the publications shares a differentn matchkey with even more publications the network representing a work grows.n Moving beyond visualization we can also gain statistical indicators from the graph to evaluate a workn cluster. Degree, average path length or centrality measures can offer information about the internaln structure of a work cluster. Particularly with large clusters information about the degree ofn connections between the members and the existence of more closely related subclusters is importantn for evaluating clusters.n Using graph visualization thus not only assists in grasping the internal structure of a work clustern more clearly but also helps managing and evaluating large datasets, ultimately leading to bettern clustering results to support data representation and findability."

The algorithmic solution, and visualisation, is fully presented to the reader. Results reveal a control policy that forecasts the future behaviour of business processes operation. Compared with related work that analyses past executions from available data, our solution has the advantage of forecasting decision impacts from current data. Moreover, this solution supports the management decisions, providing control policy graphs that express the impacts of decisions in the organisational operation, and therefore, minimises the risk of making wrong decisions. In the end, organisation is enforced with resiliency capabilities that are triggered whenever any misalignment occurs."

Introduction: We aim to visualize and analyze the science map of Cochrane systematic reviews with the high altmetric attention scores. Methods: On 10 May 2019, altmetric data of Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews obtained from Altmetric database (Altmetric LLP, London, UK). Bibliometric data of top 5% Cochrane systematic reviews further extracted from Web of Science. keyword co-occurrence, co-authorship and co-citation network visualization were then employed using VOSviewer software. Decision tree and random forest model were used to analyze citations pattern. Results: 12016 Cochrane systematic reviews with Altmetric attention are found (total mentions=259,968). Twitter was the most popular altmetric resource among these articles. Consequently, the top 5% (607 articles, mean altmetric score= 171.2, Confidence Level (CL) 95%= 14.4, mean citations= 42.1, CL 95%= 1.3) with the highest Altmetric score are included in the study. Keyword co-occurrence network visualization showed female, adult and child as the most accurate keywords respectively. At author level, Helen V Worthington had the greatest impact on the network. At organization and country levels, University of Oxford and U.K had the greatest impact on the network in turn. Co-citation network analysis showed that Lancet and Cochrane database of systematic reviews had the most influence on the network.

In fact, feature visualization in DNNs is able to help understanding how the computer make decisions, and thus it shows promise on finding pathological evidence from computer-aided diagnosis. In this paper, we propose a novel pathology-aware visualization approach for DNN-based glaucoma classification, which is used to locate the pathological evidence from fundus images for glaucoma. Besides, we apply the visualization framework to the glaucoma images synthesis task, through which specific pathological areas of synthesized images can be enhanced. Finally, experimental results show that the visualization heat maps can pinpoint different glaucoma pathologies with high accuracy, and that the generated glaucoma images are more pathophysiologically clear in rim loss (RL) and retinal neural fiber layer damage (RNFLD), which is verified by the ophthalmologist."

Thus, in this paper, we investigate the effects of several colormaps in network visualization using node-link diagrams. Specifically, we compare four different single- and multi-hue colormaps for node attributes, and evaluate their effectiveness in terms of task completion time and correctness rate. Our results show that participants complete their tasks significantly faster with blue (single-hue, sequential) as compared to viridis (multi-hue, sequential), RdYlBu (divergent, red-yellow-blue), and jet (rainbow) colormaps. Additionally, the overall correctness rate shows significant differences between colormaps, with viridis being the least error-prone among the colormaps studied."

Many digraphs tend to represent transitive relationships; that is they have a flow, and show a progression. When drawing digraphs the drawing style used must attempt to transmit this structural characteristic. In this dissertation, we study several optimization problems that are unique to drawing digraphs. First, we study the complexity the k-Modality problem of planar digraphs. Second, we turn to the practical task of drawing minimum width phylogenetic trees, which are used in the study of evolutionary relationships. Finally, we study a classical graph drawing problem, the One-Sided Crossing Minimization problem, in the novel evolving data setting.An embedding is k-modal if every vertex is incident to at most k pairs of consecutive edges with opposite orientations. We study the k-Modality problem, which asks for the existence of a k-modal embedding of a planar digraph. This combinatorial problem is at the very core of a variety of constrained embedding questions for planar digraphs and flat clustered networks. We characterize the complexity of finding minimum modality embeddings, relate it to other graph drawing problems, both directed and undirected, and present fixed-parameter tractable algorithms for some important families.We then study the problem of drawing small width phylogenetic trees. Phylogenetic trees are xivrooted trees that describe the evolutionary relationships derived from a common ancestor. In these the vertical distance represents the amount of time that passes; thus, the length of the edges is fixed. The Phylogenetic Tree Drawing problem asks for a minimum-width orthogonal upward drawing of a phylogenetic tree. We show that finding such a drawing is NP-hard for binary trees with unconstrained combinatorial order and provide a linear-time algorithm for ordered trees. We also study several heuristic algorithms for the unconstrained case and show their effectiveness through experimentation.Finally, we study a restricted version of the One-Sided Crossing Minimization problem in the evolving data setting. Algorithms that solve this problem attempt to minimize the number of crossings between two adjacent layers when drawing layered graphs. We reduce the problem to that of sorting a list in the evolving data setting and study it from this viewpoint. In this model, a sorting algorithm maintains an approximation to the sorted order of a list of data items while simultaneously, with each comparison made by the algorithm, an adversary randomly swaps the order of adjacent items in the true sorted order. The experiments we perform in this dissertation provide empirical evidence that some quadratic-time algorithms such as insertion sort and bubble sort are asymptotically optimal for any constant rate of random swaps. In fact, these algorithms perform as well as or better than algorithms such as quicksort that are more efficient in the traditional algorithm analysis model."

However, naive node-link diagrams can fail to convey insights regarding network structures, even for moderately sized data of a few hundred nodes. We propose to apply the mapper construction--a popular tool in topological data analysis--to graph visualization, which provides a strong theoretical basis for summarizing network data while preserving their core structures. We develop a variation of the mapper construction targeting weighted, undirected graphs, called mapper on graphs, which generates property-preserving summaries of graphs. We provide a software tool that enables interactive explorations of such summaries and demonstrates the effectiveness of our method for synthetic and real-world data. The mapper on graphs approach we propose represents a new class of techniques that leverages tools from topological data analysis in addressing challenges in graph visualization."

The most popular visual representation of networks is the node-link diagram. However, visualizing a large network with the node-link diagram can be challenging due to the difficulty in obtaining an optimal graph layout. To address this challenge, a recent advancement in network representation: network shape, allows one to compactly represent a network and its subgraphs with the distribution of their embeddings. Inspired by this research, we have designed a web platform WebShapes that enables researchers and practitioners to visualize their network data as customized 3D shapes (http://b.link/webshapes). Furthermore, we provide a case study on real-world networks to explore the sensitivity of network shapes to different graph sampling, embedding, and fitting methods, and we show examples of understanding networks through their network shapes."

These algorithms can be applied to a plethora of applications such as data visualization, social network analysis, crypto-currency transactions, and wireless sensor networks. Due to their effectiveness in visualization of topological data, various force-directed algorithms for 2D graphs were proposed in recent years. Although force-directed algorithms for 2D graphs were extensively investigated in research community, the algorithms for 3D graph visualization were rarely reported in the literature. In this paper, we propose four novel clustering-based force-directed (CFD) algorithms for visualization of 3D graphs. By using clustering algorithms, we divide a large graph into many smaller graphs so that they can be effectively processed by force-directed algorithms. In addition, weights are also introduced to further enhance the calculation for clusters. The proposed CFD algorithms are tested on 3 datasets with varying numbers of nodes. The experimental results show that proposed algorithms can significantly reduce edge crossings in visualization of large 3D graphs. The results also reveal that CFD algorithms can also reduce Kamada and Kawai energy and standardized variance of edge lengths in 3D graph visualization."

Benson, David F. Gleich","In the simplest setting, graph visualization is the problem of producing a set of two-dimensional coordinates for each node that meaningfully shows connections and latent structure in a graph. Among other uses, having a meaningful layout is often useful to help interpret the results from network science tasks such as community detection and link prediction. There are several existing graph visualization techniques in the literature that are based on spectral methods, graph embeddings, or optimizing graph distances. Despite the large number of methods, it is still often challenging or extremely time consuming to produce meaningful layouts of graphs with hundreds of thousands of vertices. Existing methods often either fail to produce a visualization in a meaningful time window, or produce a layout colorfully called a “hairball”, which does not illustrate any internal structure in the graph. Here, we show that adding higher-order information based on cliques to a classic eigenvector based graph visualization technique enables it to produce meaningful plots of large graphs. We further evaluate these visualizations along a number of graph visualization metrics and we find that it outperforms existing techniques on a metric that uses random walks to measure the local structure. Finally, we show many examples of how our algorithm successfully produces layouts of large networks. Code to reproduce our results is available."

Twitter prompts users to disseminate a new topic and get involved in forming opinions around it. It is always of interest how and why some tweets get more attention and involve more users, especially in the case of social issues and political debates. In this paper, we use an attention-based deep learning model to extract the topics of discussion on Twitter. Then, we reconstruct the network of discussion threads to visualize a topic-aware network of discussions. The proposed method yields the amount of attention given by users to different topics over time. As a case study, we applied our analyses to discussion threads around tweets by President Donald Trump during 9 months. Such analyses help us to understand how much each topic triggers discussions, how the topics are interrelated, and how opinions form around the tweets."

However, these methods are mostly focused on the efficiency of final results and rarely provide sufficient evidence and details on factors that contribute to their outcomes This is why a growing demand for analysis techniques appeared. Thanks to visualisation techniques we can if network works as expected or even improve output of given model if possible. Moreover we can use these methods as optimization technique to boost network’s performance but pruning less important neurons. Finally, if we know how a given model works we can prepare a disruption to its work process.

These have been primarily been used to enhance the user experience. In contrast, conveying information via data charts, such as a line graph, remains largely unexplored. To address this gap, we developed a tactile display prototype. Our prototype uses skin-dragging, a method to produce longer tactile perceptions from dragging a tip on the skin, as the primary means to convey the data. We postulate that if such an approach is successful, it could convey the data in eyes-free scenarios, an element common for on-the-go computing. In an experiment (n=12), we compare the recognition performance of graphs with two different skin-dragging properties, Full-Drag and Dot. The results show that participants performed both techniques equally well, but our Full-Drag technique was greatly preferred. We conclude with design guidelines for tactile displays that focus on graph representations."

This is the extent to which the completeness of the test case in the tested unit program meets the code coverage criteria. Testers usually design test cases just by looking at the source code for which it is very likely that the test case is incomplete or missing. There are currently many tools to check the coverage test cases. These tools only provide information on the percentage of line code that has been executed. On the other hand, the information from the testing results is presented in the form of XML, HTML or other formats that contain the line code status. It causes the information is still difficult to understand, especially for the beginner testers.

Safisamghabadi, D. Sanford, Christoph Schaal, Christoph Schaal","Background: Despite a wealth of literature on medical high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU), there are knowledge gaps related to therapeutic ultrasound in the presence of bone obstructions. In particular, the literature on detailed imaging of ultrasonic wave-scattering at bones to validate numerical models is still sparse. Objective: Experimentally investigate the ultrasonic energy deposition in areas surrounding flat and curved bone-like obstructions. Methods: Imaging from a diffraction-based shadowgraph method is used to visualize ultrasound wave propagation in laboratory water tank experiments. The experiments are performed with no obstruction, varying partial obstruction, and with complete obstruction by bone-like constructs. In addition, hydrophone measurements and numerical simulations are performed for similar bone obstruction configurations, and the results are compared. Results: The shadowgraph technique produces high-resolution images of the wave transmission through and reflection from bone-like constructs. There is generally good agreement between experimental findings and numerical results. In particular, hydrophone measurements match closely with simulation data for both obstructed and unobstructed cases. Also, shadowgraph images qualitatively confirm simulation and hydrophone measurements. Conclusions: Overall, the results of this work demonstrate the utility of shadowgraph imaging in the development and evaluation of novel treatments in the field of therapeutic ultrasound."

This work utilizes convolutional neural networks to classify packets after their conversion to an image matrix. To help address network challenges and aid in visualization, packets are combined into larger images to provide greater insight into a particular time span. Applications of this research can use the surrounding temporal area to gain insight into conversations, exchanges, losses and threats. We demonstrate the use of this technique to identify potential latency problems.

Reference networks, such as a graph of known protein-protein interactions, can be used to place experimental data in the context of biological pathways, making the results more interpretable. The first step in network-based visualization and modeling involves mapping the measured experimental endpoints to network nodes, but in targeted assays many network nodes have no corresponding measured endpoints. This leads to a novel problem – given full network structure and a subset of vertices that correspond to measured protein endpoints, infer connectivity between those vertices. We solve the problem by defining a semi-lazy random walk in directed graphs, and quantifying the mean first-passage time for graph nodes. Using simulated and real networks and data, we show that the graph connectivity structure inferred by the proposed method has higher agreement with underlying biology than two alternative strategies."

We utilize a spectral sparsification approach to reduce the number of attraction force computations to sublinear in the number of edges for dense graphs. We also present a smart initialization method based on radial tree drawing of the BFS spanning tree rooted at the center.

METHODS/STUDY POPULATION: Scholarly productivity of KL2 scholars were tracked using REDCap. For bibliometric data analysis and visualization, publications were queried using iCite (NIH Office of Portfolio Analysis) and Web of Science database. A total of 173 publications produced by eight KL2 scholars from 2013-2018 were analyzed and categorized into pre-award, during award, and post-award periods. iCite was used to assess scientific influence and translation. Scientific networks and collaboration were visualized using VOSviewer (Centre for Science and Technology Studies, Leiden University). CTSA Common Metrics were tracked using the Results Based Accountability framework. RESULTS/ANTICIPATED RESULTS: Albeit of modest size, the Miami CTSI’s KL2 Program had significant scientific productivity and impact in its first five years. Our KL2 scholars’ publications were cited twice as frequently as other papers in their fields. Further, 48% of publications post KL2 award were above the NIH 50th percentile and had higher citation impact compared to the average NIH-funded paper; 11% were in the top 10% NIH citation ranking. In contrast, only 20% of the publications pre-KL2 award were above the NIH 50th percentile. The program also promoted research collaboration; network visualizations indicate larger co-authorship and organization networks of KL2 scholars post-award. DISCUSSION/SIGNIFICANCE OF IMPACT: Bibliometric and data visualization approaches helped us better identify trends and gauge effectiveness of the KL2 program. These findings provided useful insight into the scientific influence and impact of our scholars’ work."

Many datasets are coded with hierarchical terminologies, e.g., the international classification of Diseases-9, Medical Subject Heading, and Gene Ontology, to name a few. In this paper, we study the problem of selecting a diverse set of k elements to summarize an input dataset with hierarchical terminologies, and visualize the summary in an ontology structure. We propose an efficient greedy algorithm to solve the problem with (1-1/e) = 62% -approximation guarantee. Although this greedy solution achieves quality-guaranteed answers approximately but it is still not optimal. To tackle the problem optimally, we further develop a dynamic programming algorithm to obtain optimal answers for graph visualization of log-data using ontology terminologies called OVDO . The complexity and correctness of OVDO are theoretically analyzed. In addition, we propose a useful optimization technique of tree reduction to remove useless nodes with zero weights and shrink the tree into a smaller one, which ensures the efficiency acceleration of OVDO in many real-world applications. Extensive experimental results on real-world datasets show the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed approximate and exact algorithms for tree data summarization."

Typical examples are social networks, biological networks, and information networks. This double structural nature makes it difficult to adopt a homogeneous visualization model that clearly conveys both an overview of the network and the internal structure of its communities at the same time. As a consequence, the use of hybrid visualizations has been proposed. For instance, NodeTrix combines node-link and matrix-based representations (Henry et al., 2007). In this article we describe ChordLink, a hybrid visualization model that embeds chord diagrams, used to represent dense subgraphs, into a node-link diagram, which shows the global network structure. The visualization makes it possible to interactively highlight the structure of a community while keeping the rest of the layout stable. We discuss the intriguing algorithmic challenges behind the ChordLink model, present a prototype system that implements it, and illustrate case studies on real-world networks."

However, even the best network layout algorithms ultimately result in 'hairball' visualisations when the graph reaches a certain degree of complexity, requiring simplification through aggregation or interaction (such as filtering) to remain usable. Until now, there has been little data to indicate at what level of complexity node-link diagrams become ineffective or how visual complexity affects cognitive load. To this end, we conducted a controlled study to understand workload limits for a task that requires a detailed understanding of the network topology---finding the shortest path between two nodes. We tested performance on graphs with 25 to 175 nodes with varying density. We collected performance measures (accuracy and response time), subjective feedback, and physiological measures (EEG, pupil dilation, and heart rate variability). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first network visualisation study to include physiological measures. Our results show that people have significant difficulty finding the shortest path in high-density node-link diagrams with more than 50 nodes and even low-density graphs with more than 100 nodes. From our collected EEG data we observe functional differences in brain activity between hard and easy tasks. We found that cognitive load increased up to a certain level of difficulty after which it decreased, likely because participants had given up. We also explored the effects of global network layout features such as size or number of crossings, and features of the shortest path such as length or straightness on task difficulty. We found that global features generally had a greater impact than those of the shortest path."

In this paper, a research is implemented on the adversarial example attack and neural network interpretability. The neural network interpretability research is believed to have considerable potential in resisting adversarial examples. It helped understand how the adversarial examples induce the neural network to make a wrong judgment and identify adversarial examples in the test set. The corresponding algorithm was designed and the image recognition model was built based on the ImageNet training set.

Faria, Bruno A. N. Travençolo","Visual analysis of temporal networks comprises an effective way to understand the network dynamics, facilitating the identification of patterns, anomalies, and other network properties, thus resulting in fast decision making. The amount of data in real-world networks, however, may result in a layout with high visual clutter due to edge overlapping. This is particularly relevant in the so-called streaming networks, in which edges are continuously arriving (online) and in non-stationary distribution. All three network dimensions, namely node, edge, and time, can be manipulated to reduce such clutter and improve readability. This paper presents an online and nonuniform timeslicing method, thus considering the underlying network structure and addressing streaming network analyses. We conducted experiments using two real-world networks to compare our method against uniform and nonuniform timeslicing strategies. The results show that our method automatically selects timeslices that effectively reduce visual clutter in periods with bursts of events. As a consequence, decision making based on the identification of global temporal patterns becomes faster and more reliable."

Consequently, it can easily be incorporated upstream to analysis methods to augment these with a three-dimensional reconstruction of the vascular network in the tissues to be analyzed. The method combines iodine-enhanced micro-computed tomography with a deep learning algorithm to segment vasculature within tissues.

Piekos, Russ B. Altman","1. Abstract Millions of Americans suffer from illnesses with non-existent or ineffective drug treatment. Identifying plausible drug candidates is a major barrier to drug development due to the large amount of time and resources required; approval can take years when people are suffering now. While computational tools can expedite drug candidate discovery, these tools typically require programming expertise that many biologists lack. Though biomedical databases continue to grow, they have proven difficult to integrate and maintain, and non-programming interfaces for these data sources are scarce and limited in capability. This creates an opportunity for us to present a suite of user-friendly software tools to aid computational discovery of novel treatments through de novo discovery or repurposing. Our tools eliminate the need for researchers to acquire computational expertise by integrating multiple databases and offering an intuitive graphical interface for analyzing these publicly available data. We built a computational knowledge graph focused on biomedical concepts related to drug discovery, designed visualization tools that allow users to explore complex relationships among entities in the graph, and served these tools through a free and user-friendly web interface. We show that users can conduct complex analyses with relative ease and that our knowledge graph and algorithms recover approved repurposed drugs. Our evaluation indicates that our method provides an intuitive, easy, and effective toolkit for discovering drug candidates. We show that our toolkit makes computational analysis for drug development more accessible and efficient and ultimately plays a role in bringing effective treatments to all patients.

Purchase, Nathan Stirling, Daniel Archambault","The identification of groups in social networks drawn as graphs is an important task for social scientists who wish to know how a population divides with respect to relationships or attributes. Community detection algorithms identify communities (groups) in social networks by finding clusters in the graph: that is, sets of people (nodes) where the relationships (edges) between them are more numerous than their relationships with other nodes. This approach to determining communities is naturally based on the underlying structure of the network, rather than on attributes associated with nodes. In this paper, we report on an experiment that (a) compares the effectiveness of several force-directed graph layout algorithms for visually identifying communities, and (b) investigates their usefulness when group membership is based not on structure, but on attributes associated with the people in the network. We find algorithms that clearly separate communities with large distances to be most effective, while using colour to represent community membership is more successful than reliance on structural layout."

Pavlysh","Today there are several generally accepted methods of storing data in an information network. One of the most modern is the presentation of data in the form of a semi-structured (with the possibility of fuzzy formalization) set – a knowledge base. Compared to databases, this view has several advantages: the ability to store complex heterogeneous information; the ability to expand and supplement the description of the subject area without reprogramming; visibility and accessibility of knowledge presentation to the user. But this advantage of them turns into a problem, which currently has been only partially solved. The data in the knowledge base can be in such a form that their presentation according to formalized rules and algorithms is impossible or ineffective. Currently, the most promising in terms of representing data structures is considered to be an ontological representation that copes well with displaying an arbitrary structure. Most of the visual representations of ontologies (Protégé in integration with OWLViz, OntoGraf, 3D Hyperbolyc, Tree, etc.) are images of nodes as a set of conditional points (small geometric shapes) connected by lines –ontographs. This approach to visualization is less informative and inconvenient to apply to the educational process. The need to create new approaches to the presentation of information, implement its accessibility and efficiency of usage is becoming increasingly important. Along with traditional information support in the form of databases, knowledge bases have begun to develop at a tremendous pace, which, when used effectively, provide significant competitive advantages. An important feature of knowledge bases is the ability to work with approximate sets. The authors developed ontograph visualization technology, partially implemented on the Ontos.xyz web resource. This resource allows you to visualize the vertices of the ontograph, the connections between them and assign each set of contexts that are related to it. Each of the nodes of the ontograph contains a specific descriptive context. The main feature of the Ontos editor is the ability to assign each node a context of all types supported by the browser. Including html pages, web 2.0 resources, etc. Also, the proposed system implements the visualization of knowledge bases, consisting of two components: a navigator that determines the path to some node of the ontograph that has children and a visualization slider for this node that displays these elements. The knowledge base viewer is a slider that resembles a photo gallery slider with advanced navigation. The ontological approach to servicing knowledge bases can be not only a means of organizing knowledge. The knowledge bases developed on the basis of the ontological approach make it possible to work actively with knowledge, to solve problems associated with education, the development of artificial intelligence, decision-making systems, and many other areas where approximate sets can be used."

Visualizing a knowledge graph helps humans gain a deep understanding of the facts, leading to new insights and concepts. However, the massive and complex nature of knowledge graphs has brought many longstanding challenges, especially to attract non-expert users. This paper discusses these challenges; we turned them into a generic knowledge-graph visualization framework, namely KGViz, consisting of four dimensions: modularity, intuitive user interface, performance, and access control. Our implementation of KGViz is a high-capacity, extendable, and scalable KG visualizer, which we designed to promotes community contributions."

Vertices are mapped to two vertical parallel axes. The left axis depicts the source vertices, whereas the right one depicts the destination vertices. The time axis is horizontally embedded in-between the two axes, resulting in a two-dimensional graph layout. Edges are added by drawing straight lines connecting the corresponding source and destination vertices through time, while the pixels along the lines are used to encode the time-varying information. In this way, the depiction of edges at the individual timepoints is reduced to only a few pixels, resulting in a less cluttered representation of dynamic graphs, while the alignment of edges over time reveals the temporal patterns in the data and preserves the users’ mental map. We evaluate our approach by comparing it theoretically and empirically against the state-of-the-art using dynamic graphs of varying complexities."

S. Raghukumar, R. M. Udaya Kumar, K. Ashirvadam, Jenson Isaac","Screech combustion instabilities are high frequency (>1000 Hz) transverse periodic oscillations driven by combustion and which are then manifested as large amplitude oscillations in the afterburner duct pressure, accompanied by the characteristic high-pitched audible tones. These screech instabilities which are detrimental to the engine are conventionally suppressed by embedding Helmholtz resonator arrays in the afterburner liner. This method has been found inadequate when mixed mode combustion instability oscillations occur and also when the frequencies of oscillation were lower. The design of practical Helmholtz resonator arrays is classified and so is not available in the open domain. Hence, it was necessary to evolve a robust design solution to mitigate screech combustion instabilities in an afterburner. In an afterburner, V-gutters are used as flame stabilizers. The high Reynolds number flow past a V-gutter array is dominated by the presence of vortices characterized by the Kelvin–Helmholtz instability, which is a convective flow instability related to the shear layers separating from the V-gutter lips and the Benard–von Karman instability which is related to the asymmetric vortex shedding of the flow in the flame holder wake. The shedding of von Karman vortices at non-reacting and near the blowout conditions, and the transition from a Kelvin–Helmholtz instability to that of a Bernard–von Karman instability during near flame blowout create conditions for the frequency to get locked-on to the duct transverse acoustic mode frequency; screech is triggered. Hence, a smart flame stabilization method which has the intrinsic property of preventing the lock-on between the frequency of the vortex shedding from the V-gutter and the duct transverse acoustic frequency was developed. The test rig with optically accessible critical zones around the V-gutter flame stabilizer had the capability to operate the afterburner model under simulated inlet conditions of pressure and temperatures. A FastCam SA-4 Photron high-speed camera was used in this experimental investigation and high-speed shadowgraph flow visualization studies were carried out to develop a comprehensive method of introducing an aerodynamic splitter plate concept through a ventilated V-gutter; mitigation of screech combustion instability has been demonstrated.KeywordsCombustion instabilityVentilated V-gutterScreechAfterburnerScreech mitigation"

Sometimes it is worth more attention, especially when individuals are represented. Visually translating communities in networks, for example, implies that some individuals are always situated at the borders of the representation. This assumption is clearly unfair, especially if each individual of the community is connected with everybody else. To solve this lack of design justice, the community is represented on a spherical network where the surface is continuous. In that space, individuals can be situated in a sparse area, but never on the edges. The spherical network is successively projected on the flat surface to improve the network readability making use of cartographic projections."

In such cases, musicians create external representations of a music style domain as source for reflection, inspiration and collaboration. However, due to the large number of music examples, creating such representations can be essential, but at the same time, slow and costly.In this paper, we show that interactive visualization and machine learning could aid in supporting and enhancing musician cognition and team-based collaboration. Specifically, we propose an approach to this problem which: (1) allows musicians to visually externalize their evolving mental models of a music domain, in the form of thematically organized anchored pairs. i.e., (narrative, graph), each one corresponding to a specific music pattern, and (2) uses such pairs to develop a music style classification system based on machine learning, as support for musicians during their activities (composition, performance). To this end, we introduce a novel graph representation of music stylistic patterns and discuss the advantages of linking such a representation to machine learning. Results of a preliminary study involving 10 musicians provided us with overall positive feedback about the effectiveness of our approach as well as further directions to explore."

Most of these illegal contents are distributed on anonymous networks that cannot be directly accessed from the World Wide Web. A lot of research has been done on the network structure of the World Wide Web since the advent of the Web. However, even in the dark web, which is connected by HTTP like the World Wide Web, the web learned method can be used. There are many studies on the dark web, but not as many studies on the visualization of the dark web network structure as those done on the World Wide Web, and there are no studies investigating the temporal change of the network structure of the dark web. In this paper, in order to understand the HTML network structure of the dark web, we have created and visualized a graph from the HTML link relations of the Tor network that is popular in the dark web. We analyzed 14,369,621 pages of HTML text files crawled from the Tor network by breadth-first search during the period between June 1 2018 and May 31 2020. Then, we made snapshots from the collected data divided by the time span of half a year, and investigated the time change of the dark web network using a time series graph. As a result, the dark web became visually larger and more complex in the last two years. In each snapshot, the difference between the increasing and decreasing domains was visualized, and it was clarified that there was no bias in domain changes. Then, from the change of the hub node of each snapshot, it was clarified that for the dark web changed from the information retrieval method link-dominated to search-engine-dominated."

Far","Multiagent Systems (MAS) consists of many software agents that interact to each other to perform their actions and achieve system goals. Due to the growing demand of Distributed Software Systems (DSS) and MAS as a branch of DSS, the verification of these systems has taken a special attention. The verification of these systems is required because MAS and DSS are large scale systems, where a failure can result in a huge amount of cost or damage. One major field is verification of MAS designs to prevent cost of fixing problems after implementation and deployment. The agents and interactions among them form a network of agents. This network can be used for verification of MAS from different perspectives and by various techniques. Visualizing agentsxe2x80x99 networks can lead to detect a special type of unexpected behavior in MAS referred to as emergent behaviors and implied scenarios. These unexpected behaviors are more probable in large scale systems because the functionality and control are distributed and there is lack of central controller in MAS and DSS. Consequently, a new scenario can be implied to the system at run time which may not be an acceptable behavior in the system. In this article, visualization techniques are applied to form three different networks extracted from the designs of MAS for this purpose. These networks are used to detect emergent behaviors and implied scenarios in the system. The methodology, system architecture, data preparation and visualization, required network definitions, and results are verified through case studies."

These diagrams aimed at providing better readability to the user. Finding the best drawing strategy for a visually pleasing diagram is really challenging as it depends upon the quality and allowed time expected in the output. Almost all the existing graph drawing algorithms have a linear time-variant, but their practical implementation time differs widely. Existing platforms provide only a small number of algorithmic choices, so there is a difficulty in comparing all the algorithms for a particular task. In this paper, we describe GLDraw, our graph visualization tool. GLDraw (Graph Layout Drawing) provides the user, a choice of different graph drawing layouts and heuristics to improve the quality of the drawing. We have used GLDraw to find out the best strategy to draw planar graphs and perform a comparative study based on the time taken to produce the output for different graph drawing algorithms (or layouts). GLDraw also supports simultaneous drawing of shared graphs as well as multiple drawings of different graphs. The drawing techniques provided are hierarchical, orthogonal, grid, and force-directed methods. We have found that for different types of graphs, choosing an appropriate layout plays a vital role in achieving a quality drawing, for example, in case of tree graphs planarization grid and for general planar graphs force-directed would be the better option."

To address this gap, we conduct a systematic review of human mobility-related studies published from 1990 to 2020. Drawing on the selected publications retrieved from the Web of Science, we provide a bibliometric analysis and network visualisation using CiteSpace and VOSviewer on the number of publications and year published, authors and their countries and afflictions, citations, topics, abstracts, keywords, and journals. Our findings show that human mobility-related studies have become increasingly interdisciplinary and multi-dimensional, which have been strengthened by the use of the so-called ‘big data’ from multiple sources, the development of computer technologies, the innovation of modelling approaches, and the novel applications in various areas.

Most of the illegal content is distributed on anonymous networks that cannot be directly accessed from the World Wide Web. A number of studies have been conducted on the network structure of the World Wide Web since its advent. Similar to the World Wide Web, the dark web is connected by hypertext transfer protocol (http); this makes it possible to use the methods developed for the web in the dark web. Many studies have investigated the dark web and its network structure. However, few studies have focused on the visualization of the dark web network structure, and there have been no studies investigating the temporal changes in the network structure. In this study, to understand the hypertext markup language (html) network structure of the dark web, we created and visualized a graph of the html hyperlink relations of the Tor network, which is popular on the dark web. We then compared the insights gained from graph centrality metrics with those gained from visualizations. The analyzed dataset comprised 25,270,157 pages of html text files crawled from the Tor network by breadth-first search from June 1, 2018, to January 30, 2021. Subsequently, we acquired half-yearly snapshots from the collected data and investigated the change in the dark web network over time using a time-series graph. Then, we derived the centrality metrics from the created graph data and confirmed the differences between the centrality metrics and visualizations. The results obtained in this study provided new insights into the dark web. First, we found that the dark web fluctuated significantly; the structure of the dark web network was more strongly interconnected. Second, most of the nodes that had increased in the past two years may have disappeared rapidly after May 2020. Third, analysis of each snapshot revealed that the proportion of highly volatile domains increased from 40% to 75% during the observation period. Fourth, after calculating the network centrality metrics from each snapshot and comparing the transition of hub nodes in chronological order, we observed that the importance of link-collection sites as the main information retrieval method used in the dark web decreased. Finally, we estimated the size of the dark web based on our observed dark web measurements using the mark-recapture method. To the best of our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst study to use the mark-recapture method to estimate the size of the dark web network."

Vineetha, Srinjoy Ghosh","In this paper, we expound our theoretical hypothesis covering effective visualization factors in the area of visual analytics for a knowledge graph (KG) considering human cognition aspects of inferencing. The paper reflects on the first and foremost challenge with visualizations—which is effectively harnessing the potential of a knowledge graph visually. While there is a progress on the technical front in allowing an inference to be queried, there is limited scope to do the same visually. The second challenge identified is when the user has to use his mental space and cognitive reserve to conflate and schematize knowledge to infer. There are certain constraints with this as to how the human attention is efficiently oriented toward the relevant information and the visualized information is not cognitively loaded for the user to infer from it. As far as the visualization aspect of the knowledge graph is concerned, the aim is to reduce the cognitive resources used for building a new schema of the task inside long-term memory. Hence, the proposed inferencing variable in the paper enables the release of space and conserves the cognitive reserve for further higher cognitive process of decision making. It also includes the elements of motivation for the user to visualize knowledge in knowledge graphs and an overview of the existing visualizations of KG."

Fischer, Alexander Frings, Daniel A. Keim, Daniel Seebacher","Leveraging hypergraph structures to model advanced processes has gained much attention over the last few years in many areas, ranging from protein-interaction in computational biology to image retrieval using machine learning. Hypergraph models can provide a more accurate representation of the underlying processes while reducing the overall number of links compared to regular representations. However, interactive visualization methods for hypergraphs and hypergraph-based models have rarely been explored or systematically analyzed. This paper reviews the existing research landscape for hypergraph and hypergraph model visualizations and assesses the currently employed techniques. We provide an overview and a categorization of proposed approaches, focusing on performance, scalability, interaction support, successful evaluation, and the ability to represent different underlying data structures, including a recent demand for a temporal representation of interaction networks and their improvements beyond graph-based methods. Lastly, we discuss the strengths and weaknesses of the approaches and give an insight into the future challenges arising in this emerging research field."
3184509495,21466,Improved plagiarism detection with collaboration network visualization based on source-code similarity,2021-05-17,13,0,,,2021,,"Matija Novak, Mike Joy, Olfat M. Mirza","Plagiarism detection is a serious problem in higher education. Teachers use similarity (plagiarism) detection systems, which highlight similarities between student documents, to help them find plagiarism. Most systems are built for text but there are special systems to find similarities between source-code files. In most cases the results are presented in table form showing similarities between pairs of documents in descending order by similarity, and then a teacher is responsible for confirming which similar documents represent cases of plagiarism. While most systems present their results in the form of tables, only few of them present the results as a graph. Some studies indicate that using clustering algorithms to represent such data graphically can improve the speed and accuracy of finding potential instances of plagiarism in large collections of source-code files. The purpose of the study is to answer the following research questions. Can visualization of student solutions (of source-code similarities) in collaboration networks form help identify new cases of plagiarism? What are the steps to do so? The study was designed in a form of two case studies where one was performed on a graduate level university course and one on a course in professional studies. The article presents empirical results describing two cases where a collaboration network (based on source-code similarity) representation has been used. The article argues that the graphical presentation is able to identify new clusters of plagiarised source-code files that would have been missed using existing tabular presentation of data."

Daily around 1.8 billion images are added to the Internet and most of the data on the Internet is public. So, it is desired to make sure that images are secure before transmitting through an insecure network like the Internet. Various techniques are used for the protection of these digital images like steganography, watermarking, and encryption. These methods are used for achieving security goals like confidentiality, integrity, and availability. Individually none of the methods can achieve all security goals, so, this paper presents you a blended approach of the above-mentioned methods. A modern approach of using artificial neural network is proposed in this paper. In ANN, we will focus particularly on convolutional neural network (CNN). Since CNN works on the pixels of the image and deals with the subject like object detection, face recognition, so, it will enhance the current methods in terms of efficiency, accuracy, and computational power and will improve the security of image. The method presented in this paper is efficient and secured against the attacks and risks related to data."

Elegantly visualizing the relationships between nodes with complex metadata of nodes and edges appended may inspire new insights. Here, we developed the crosslink R package, tailored for network visualization of grouped nodes, to provide a series of flexible functions for generating network diagrams. We first designed a CrossLink class for storage of metadata about nodes and edges and manipulation of node coordinates. Then affine transformation and function mapping transformation are implemented to perform fundamental node coordinates transformation by groups, based on which various network layouts can be defined easily. For convenience, we predefined several commonly used layouts, including row, column, arc, polygon and hive, which also can be combined in one layout. Finally, we designed a user-friendly wrapper function to draw network connections, aesthetic mappings of metadata and decoration with related annotation graphs in one interface by taking advantage of the powerful ggplot2 system. Overall, the crosslink R package is easy-to-use for achieving complex visualization of a network diagram of grouped nodes surrounded by associated annotation graphs. Availability and Implementation Cosslink is an open-source R package, freely available from github: https://github.com/zzwch/crosslink ; A detailed user documentation can be found in https://zzwch.github.io/crosslink/ ."

Firstly, the traditional force-directed algorithm is improved to generate a multi-force guidance network layout result with obvious community characteristics. On this basis, a hierarchical clustering algorithm is used to establish a network hierarchy from bottom to top, allowing users to observe hierarchical network topology through multiple interactive operations hierarchical network topology. In order to verify the effectiveness of the method, two multi-layer network instance data are selected for experiments. The visualization results show that the method can effectively display the community structure and hierarchical structure of the multi-layer network, and help users understand and analyze its structural characteristics."

In particular, the popular NodeTrix model, introduced by Henry, Fekete, and McGuffin in 2007, combines node-link diagrams and matrix-based representations to support the analysis of real-world networks that are globally sparse but locally dense. That idea inspired a series of works, proposing variants or alternatives to NodeTrix. We present a user study that compares the classical node-link model and three hybrid visualization models designed to work on the same types of networks. The results of our study provide interesting indications about advantages/drawbacks of the considered models on performing classical tasks of analysis. At the same time, our experiment has some limitations and opens up to further research on the subject."

Roa-Valverde, Anna Fensel","Knowledge graphs facilitate systematic large-scale data analysis by providing both human and machine-readable structures, which can be shared across different domains and platforms. Nowadays, knowledge graphs can be used to standardise the collection and sharing of user information in many different sectors such as transport, insurance, smart cities and internet of things. Regulations such as the GDPR make sure that users are not taken advantage of when they share data. From a legal standpoint it is necessary to have the user’s consent to collect information. This consent is only valid if the user is aware about the information collected at all times. To increase this awareness, we present a knowledge graph visualisation approach, which informs users about the activities linked to their data sharing agreements, especially after they have already given their consent. To visualise the graph, we introduce a user-centred application which showcases sensor data collection and distribution to different data processors. Finally, we present the results of a user study conducted to find out whether this visualisation leads to more legal awareness and trust. We show that with our visualisation tool data sharing consent rates increase from 48% to 81.5%."

Individual differences in how users interact with and respond to visualisations presents an opportunity to inform how we construct visualisations. In this study, we chose to explore the effect of cognitive style on users’ performance in network visualisations. Three psychological constructs were used to account for individual differences: the Verbal-Imagery Cognitive Style, Rational-Experiential Inventory and Wholist-Analytic Cognitive Style. Using a sample of university students, we measured participants accuracy, effort, time, and efficiency to complete three separate tasks on network visualisations.

This data captured goes beyond monolithic genetic sequences and towards circuit modularity and functional details, which are beneficial for analyzing circuit performance and establishing design automation techniques. However, the accessibility, visualisation and usability of design data (and metadata) have received relatively little attention to date. Here, we present a method to turn circuit designs into networks and showcase its potential to enhance the utility of design data. Since networks are dynamic structures, initial graphs can be interactively shaped into sub-networks of relevant information based on requirements such as abstraction, hierarchy and protein interactions. Additionally, several visual changes can be applied, such as colouring or clustering nodes based on types (e.g., genes or promoters), resulting in easier comprehension from a user perspective. This approach allows circuit designs to be coupled to other networks, such as metabolic pathways or implementation protocols captured in graph-like formats. Therefore, we advocate using networks to structure, access and improve synthetic biology information."

Social media platforms such as Twitter have played an important role in the public discussion about COVID-19 vaccines.The aim of this study was to investigate message-level drivers of the popularity and virality of tweets about COVID-19 vaccines using machine-based text-mining techniques. We further aimed to examine the topic communities of the most liked and most retweeted tweets using network analysis and visualization.We collected US-based English-language public tweets about COVID-19 vaccines from January 1, 2020, to April 30, 2021 (N=501,531). Topic modeling and sentiment analysis were used to identify latent topics and valence, which together with autoextracted information about media presence, linguistic features, and account verification were used in regression models to predict likes and retweets. Among the 2500 most liked tweets and 2500 most retweeted tweets, network analysis and visualization were used to detect topic communities and present the relationship between the topics and the tweets.Topic modeling yielded 12 topics. The regression analyses showed that 8 topics positively predicted likes and 7 topics positively predicted retweets, among which the topic of vaccine development and people's views and that of vaccine efficacy and rollout had relatively larger effects. Network analysis and visualization revealed that the 2500 most liked and most retweeted retweets clustered around the topics of vaccine access, vaccine efficacy and rollout, vaccine development and people's views, and vaccination status. The overall valence of the tweets was positive. Positive valence increased likes, but valence did not affect retweets. Media (photo, video, gif) presence and account verification increased likes and retweets. Linguistic features had mixed effects on likes and retweets.This study suggests the public interest in and demand for information about vaccine development and people's views, and about vaccine efficacy and rollout. These topics, along with the use of media and verified accounts, have enhanced the popularity and virality of tweets. These topics could be addressed in vaccine campaigns to help the diffusion of content on Twitter."

METHODS: We develop MatrixFlow, a visual analytic system that takes clinical event sequences of patients as input, constructs time-evolving networks and visualizes them as a temporal flow of matrices. MatrixFlow provides several interactive features for analysis: 1) one can sort the events based on the similarity in order to accentuate underlying cluster patterns among those events; 2) one can compare co-occurrence events over time and across cohorts through additional line graph visualization. RESULTS: MatrixFlow is applied to visualize heart failure (HF) symptom events extracted from a large cohort of HF cases and controls (n=50,625), which allows medical experts to reach insights involving temporal patterns and clusters of interest, and compare cohorts in novel ways that may lead to improved disease diagnoses. CONCLUSIONS: MatrixFlow is an interactive visual analytic system that allows users to quickly discover patterns in clinical event sequences. By unearthing the patterns hidden within and displaying them to medical experts, users become empowered to make decisions influenced by historical patterns."

Often, various domain experts work together to improve the analysis time or the quality of the analysis results. Collaborative visualization tools can facilitate this process. We propose a new web-based visualization environment which supports distributed, synchronous and asynchronous collaboration for graphs with up to 10,000 nodes and edges. In addition to standard collaboration features like event tracking or synchronizing, our client/server-based system provides visualization and interaction techniques for better navigation, guidance and overview of the overall data set. During asynchronous collaborations, network changes made by specific analysts or even just visited elements are highlighted on demand by heat maps. These heat map representations are user-sensitive in a sense that the current analyst is able to perceive which changes were made by others."

Unsteady flow and complex mixing of fuel, air and residual hot gases in a pulsejet make analysis, modeling and scaling extremely challenging. A general methodology for the design of optimized pulsejet geometry is still not available. In order to evolve such a design methodology, high speed flow visualization, employing a unique twin-beam shadowgraph technique, has been developed and effectively used to better understand the detailed pulsejet flow physics. An inline - intake, rectangular crossxe2x80x93section, valveless hydrogen-fuelled pulsejet, suitably modified with optical access for flow visualization was used for this experimental study. Visualisation of the unsteady combusting flow phenomena, under sustained pulsation, as well as at starting of the pulsejet has been studied using this high-speed shadowgraph technique. This technique has been shown to be a powerful tool to arrive at what need be promising inline-intake valveless pulsejet configurations.

5999840,22242,42 – Scalable Network Visualization,2005-01-01,11,6,,,2005,,Stephen G. Eick,"This chapter defines the concept of visual scalability for networks, illustrates it with three examples, and proposes techniques to increase network visualization scalability. The focus is on the scalability of network visualizations. As with many classes of data, the ability to collect massive volumes of network data overwhelms existing analysis techniques. This is particularly true for real-world data analysis problems, where the data is heterogeneous, noisy, incomplete, highly fragmented, time-varying, and at multiple levels of abstraction. The new ideas involve the concept of visual scalability and its application to network data. Visual scalability is the capability of the visualization to effectively display large network datasets, in terms of either the number of nodes, the number of edges, the number of node or edge attributes, or other similar elements. The factors affecting visual scalability are human perception, display resolution, visual metaphor, node positioning algorithm, interactivity, data structures and algorithms, and computational infrastructure."

The resulting hairball suffers from cluttering and overplotting to an extreme that renders it unusable for any practical purposes. Since researchers have had this experience for decades, various approaches have been developed on all stages of the visualization pipeline to alleviate this problem. They range from filtering and clustering techniques on the data level to modern GPU-based techniques on the image level. This tutorial gives an overview of these techniques and discusses their applicability and interplay in different application scenarios. By doing so, it provides a unique problem-oriented perspective on the field of scalable network visualization, which is an area of active research today more than ever. The tutorial serves mainly to further the understanding of network visualization beyond the point of creating an initial layout. It thus caters to an intermediate level audience with some basic knowledge on graph layout and visualization, but it will certainly present an interesting cross-section through the larger domains of network visualization and graph drawing for established researchers as well."

To visualize such a multigraph, a clear layout representing a global structure is of great importance, and interactive visual analysis which allows the multiple edges to be adjusted in appropriate ways for detailed presentation is also essential. A novel interactive two-phase approach to visualizing and exploring multigraph is proposed. The approach consists of two phases: the first phase improves the previous popular works on force-directed methods to produce a brief drawing for the aggregation graph of the input multigraph, while the second phase proposes two interactive strategies, the magnifier model and the thematic-oriented subgraph model. The former highlights the internal details of an aggregation edge which is selected interactively by user, and draws the details in a magnifying view by cubic Bezier curves; the latter highlights only the thematic subgraph consisting of the selected multiple edges that the user concerns. The efficiency of the proposed approach is demonstrated with a real-world multigraph dataset and how it is used effectively is discussed for various potential applications."

Address: 2a, Pryanishnikova street, Moscow, 127550, Russian Federation.E-mail: achepovskiy@hse.ru The problem of huge graph visualization arises in various fields of sociology and marketing. The relevance of this work is determined by the need for the software package for analysis and visualization of such graphs. This paper introduces summary analysis of several software products and highlights their weaknesses: lack of cross-platform and specialized graph warehouses, inability to deal with huge graphs. This paper presents a detailed description of the overall architecture of the software developed and each of its modules separately, as well as a procedure for communication between core modules. A special graph warehouse capable to process graphs having up to 100 million vertices and billions of links is used to store graphs. A description of main data warehousing principles is also introduced. The use of a proprietary file system ensures the absence of additional system calls when working with the warehouse and the lack of a complex addressing system and any excessive mechanisms, that enables to avoid any extra overhead costs associated with data warehousing. Furthermore, there is a description of a methodology for data visualization module, used data structures and computer graphics algorithms, that enable to handle graphs comprising up to millions of vertices on real time basis. It is worth noting a wide range of algorithms for auto layout of graphs such as random layout, circular layout, circular component layout, peacock tail layout, one or two themes layout, layout based on community detection and estimation of cohesion. This paper presents a detailed description of each of the layout mentioned above. Special attention should be paid to the developed methods of graph analysis. Algorithms have been designed to detect communities in social networks, to evaluate graph cohesion, to find the shortest paths between any pair of vertices, graphs union and intersection, etc. A key feature of all algorithms presented in this paper is their ability to handle huge graphs."
