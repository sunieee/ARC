1020953626,20052,A fast adaptive layout algorithm for undirected graphs (extended abstract and system demonstration),1994-10-10,11,89,1191926394,,1994,Graph Drawing (GD),"Arne Frick, Andreas Ludwig, Heiko Mehldau","We present a randomized adaptive layout algorithm for nicely drawing undirected graphs that is based on the spring-embedder paradigm and contains several new heuristics to improve the convergence, including local temperatures, gravitational forces and the detection of rotations and oscillations. The proposed algorithm achieves drawings of high quality on a wide range of graphs with standard settings. Moreover, the algorithm is fast, being thus applicable on general undirected graphs of substantially larger size and complexity than before [9, 6, 3]. Aesthetically pleasing solutions are found in most cases. We give empirical data for the running time of the algorithm and the quality of the computed layouts.",1

Compared to canonical orderings, st-orderings lack a certain property that is required by many drawing methods. In this paper, we propose a new type of st-ordering for biconnected planar graphs that relates the ordering to the embedding. We describe a linear-time algorithm to obtain such an ordering and demonstrate its capabilities with two applications.",1

However, recent technologies offer 3D stereoscopic representations of high quality which allow the introduction of binocular disparities, which is one of the main depth perception cues, not provided by the 3D perspective. This paper explores the relevance of stereoscopy for the visual identification of communities, which is a task of great importance in the analysis of social networks. A user study conducted on 35 participants with graphs of various complexity shows that stereoscopy outperforms 3D perspective in the vast majority of the cases. When comparing stereoscopy with 2D layouts, the response time is significantly lower for 2D but the quality of the results closely depend on the graph complexity: for a large number of clusters and a high probability of cluster overlapping stereoscopy outperforms 2D whereas for simple structures 2D layouts are more efficient.",1

Joseph Fowler,"A proper touching triangle representation $mathcal{R}$ of an n-vertex planar graph consists of a triangle divided into n non-overlapping triangles. A pair of triangles are considered to be adjacent if they share a partial side of positive length. Each triangle in $mathcal{R}$ represents a vertex, while each pair of adjacent triangles represents an edge in the planar graph. We consider the problem of determining when a proper touching triangle representation exists for a strongly-connected outerplanar graph, which is biconnected and after the removal of all degree-2 vertices and outeredges, the resulting connected subgraph only has chord edges w.r.t. the original graph. We show that such a graph has a proper representation if and only if the graph has at most two internal faces i.e., faces with no outeredges.",1

We prove that HV-rectilinear planarity testing is NP-complete even for graphs having vertex degree at most three, which solves an open problem posed by both Manuch et al. GD 2010 and Durucher et al.

Existence of planar Lombardi drawings is known for restricted classes of graphs, such as subcubic planar graphs [4], trees [2], Halin graphs and some very symmetric planar graphs [3]. On the other hand, all 2-degenerate graphs, including all outerplanar graphs, have Lombardi drawings, but not necessarily planar ones [3].

Brandenburg, Andreas Gleiβner, Kathrin Hanauer","A graph layout describes the processing of a graph G by a data structure $mathcal{D}$ , and the graph is called a $mathcal{D}$ -graph. The vertices of G are totally ordered in a linear layout and the edges are stored and organized in $mathcal{D}$ . At each vertex, all edges to predecessors in the linear layout are removed and all edges to successors are inserted. There are intriguing relationships between well-known data structures and classes of planar graphs: The stack graphs are the outerplanar graphs [4], the queue graphs are the arched leveled-planar graphs [12], the 2-stack graphs are the subgraphs of planar graphs with a Hamilton cycle [4], and the deque graphs are the subgraphs of planar graphs with a Hamilton path [2]. All of these are proper subclasses of the planar graphs, even for maximal planar graphs.n n We introduce splittable deques as a data structure to capture planarity. A splittable deque is a deque which can be split into sub-deques. The splittable deque provides a new insight into planarity testing by a game on switching trains.

However, there are many barriers in the way of someone wishing to make use of this technology. First, a potential user must know that the technology exists, which often means she must be well-versed in the terminology and literature of the graph drawing community. Then she must locate and install an implementation, which requires that the software creators provided the correct executable for her environment, or that she has the knowledge and tools to build the application from source code. Running the newly-installed program requires sufficient computational resources (CPU power, memory, disk space). Finally, due to the wealth of different graph description formats, it is likely that she must convert her data to the format used by the program. Another translation step may be required at the end, if the program does not output the data in a format she can use.

However, when drawing planar graphs, spring embedders often produce non-plane drawings, as edge crossings do not factor into the objective function being minimized. On the other hand, there are fairly straight-forward algorithms for creating plane straight-line drawings for planar graphs, but the resulting layouts generally are not aesthetically pleasing, as vertices are often grouped in small regions and edges lengths can vary dramatically. It is known that the initial layout influences the output of a spring embedder, and yet a random layout is nearly always the default. We study the effect of using various plane initial drawings as an inputs to a spring embedder, measuring the percent improvement in reducing crossings and in increasing node separation, edge length uniformity, and angular resolution.",1

Therefore, we should distinguish links inside a site (called local-links) between links between sites (called global-links) and analyze their own graph structures.

In a variant of this last paper, Biedl/Kaufmann [4] achieve the theoretically best area bound. The idea is the following: The graph is drawn such that each edge bends exactly once. Outgoing edges leave the vertex from the right or left side, incoming edges arrive at the top or bottom side. Edges are directed in a quasi-s-t-ordering such that each vertex gets at least one incoming and one outgoing edge. Then we assign disjoint rows to the vertices such that the number of outgoing edges leaving the vertex v to different directions is nearly balanced.

We suggest an alternative method for the second step, namely, removing the minimal number of edges such that the resulting graph is k-level planar. For the final diagram the removed edges are reinserted into a k-level planar drawing. Hence, instead of considering the k-level crossing minimization problem, we suggest solving the k-level planarization problem. In this paper we address the case k=2. First, we give a motivation for our approach. Then, we address the problem of extracting a 2-level planar subgraph of maximum weight in a given 2-level graph. This problem is NP-hard. Based on a characterization of 2-level planar graphs, we give an integer linear programming formulation for the 2-level planarization problem. Moreover, we define and investigate the polytope (2mathcal{L}mathcal{P}mathcal{S})(G) associated with the set of all 2-level planar subgraphs of a given 2-level graph G. We will see that this polytope has full dimension and that the inequalities occuring in the integer linear description are facet-defining for (2mathcal{L}mathcal{P}mathcal{S})(G). The inequalities in the integer linear programming formulation can be separated in polynomial time, hence they can be used efficiently in a cutting plane method for solving practical instances of the 2-level planarization problem.

In each of such hierarchical graph models, a succinct description is capable of representing a graph (which can be thought of as the expansion of the description) whose size is exponential in the length of the description.",1

In the constructed drawings, every edge has at most three bends and length O(n). To our best knowledge, this algorithm achieves the best simultaneous bounds concerning the grid size, angular resolution, and number of bends for planar grid drawings of high-degree planar graphs. Besides the nice theoretical features, the practical drawings are aesthetically very pleasing. An implementation of our algorithm is available with the AGD-Library (Algorithms for Graph Drawing) [2, 1]. Our algorithm is based on ideas by Kant for polyline grid drawings for triconnected plane graphs [23]. In particular, our algorithm significantly improves upon his bounds on the angular resolution and the grid size for non-triconnected plane graphs. In this case, Kant could show an angular resolution of 4/3d7 and a grid size of (2n - 5) xc3x97 (3n - 6), only.",1

Tollis","In [2] we use the term DAGmap to describe space filling visualizations of DAGs according to constraints that generalize treemaps and we show that deciding whether or not a DAG admits a DAGmap drawing is NP-complete. Let G = (V,E) be a DAG with a single source s. A component st-graph Gu,v of G is a subgraph of G with a single source u and a single sink v that contains at least two edges and that is connected with the rest of G through vertex u and/or vertex v. A vertex wdominates a vertex v if every path from s to v passes through w. The dominance relation in G can be represented in compact form as a tree T, called the dominator tree of G, in which the dominators of a vertex v are its ancestors. Vertex w is the immediatedominator of v if w is the parent of v in T. A simple and fast algorithm to compute T has been proposed by Cooper et al. [1]. The postxe2x88x92dominators of G are defined as the dominators in the graph obtained from G by reversing all directed edges and assuming that all vertices are reachable from a (possibly artificial) vertex t. Using the definition of DAGmaps, it is easy to prove that in a DAGmap of G the rectangle of a vertex u includes the rectangles of all vertices that are dominated (resp. post-dominated) by u. Therefore when vertex u dominates vertex v and vertex v post-dominates vertex u then the rectangles Ru and Rv of u and v coincide. Based on this observation, we propose a heuristic algorithm that transforms a DAG G into a DAG Gxe2x80xb2 that admits a DAGmap. When G contains component st-graphs then our algorithm performs significantly fewer duplications than the transformation of G into a tree.",1

Two drawing standards will be discussed: 1) each vertex is represented by a point and 2) grid visibility representation (that is, a line segment is allowed to represent a vertex). For the first drawing standard, we show an exponential area lower bound needed for drawing hierarchically planar graphs. The lower bound holds even for hierarchical graphs without transitive arcs, in contrast to the results for upward planar drawing. Applications of some existing algorithms from upward drawing can guarantee the quadratic drawing area for grid visibility representation but do not necessarily guarantee the minimum drawing area. Motivated by this, we will present another grid visibility drawing algorithm which is efficient and guarantees the minimum drawing area.",1

The initial version of the map, the input to the process, is a plane graph along with a drawing of that graph. The derived output is also a plane graph that is combinatorially a minor of the input graph. The edges and vertices of the derived graph may be obtained through a sequence of selection and simplification operations. The positioning of those edges and vertices must be obtained through a sequence of placement and displacement operations. Considerable research and development has already been undertaken in the areas of feature selection and simplification.

We characterize feasible solutions of the COLA problem extending an existing framework for solving pure compaction problems. Based on the graph theoretical characterization, we present a branch-and--cut algorithm which computes optimally labeled orthogonal drawings for given instances of the COLA problem.

We prefer the word harmonious to aesthetic (which is probably more in common usage) as an aesthetic feeling is probably highly individual and we cannot have an ambition to define (or even approach that). We propose an approach which should capture some features of a harmonious picture by means of the notion Hereditary Fractional Length (HFL).

The hereditary approach is based on the dual approach (it may be viewed as an approach dual to the Piagetxe2x80x99s analysis of intelligence), [13]. The Hereditary Fractional Length is preserved by scaling and rotations and it is a very robust parameter which can be computed for a large class of drawings and pictures.

We give an ILP formulation that also includes the natural generalization of c-planarity testing--the maximum c-planar subgraph problem --and solve this ILP with a branch-and-cut algorithm. Our computational results show that this approach is already successful for many clustered graphs of small to medium sizes and thus can be the foundation of a practically efficient algorithm that integrates further sophisticated ILP techniques.",1

In many cases it is more desirable to simultaneously cluster the dimensions as well as the vectors themselves. This special instance of clustering, referred to as biclustering , was introduced by Hartigan [3]. It has many applications in areas including data mining, pattern recognition, and computational biology. Considerable attention has been devoted to it from the gene expression data analysis; see [5] for a nice survey. Input is represented in a data matrix, where the rows and columns of the matrix correspond to genes and conditions respectively. Each entry in the matrix reflects the expression level of a gene under a certain condition. From a graph-teoretical perspective the data matrix can be viewed as a weighted bipartite graph, where the vertex set of one partition is the set of genes and the vertex set of the other partition is the set of conditions. An existing weighted edge incident on a gene-condition pair reflects the expression level of the gene under that specific experimental condition. The biclustering problem may then be described in terms of the various versions of the biclique extraction problem in bipartite graphs. Many interesting versions that directly apply to the biclustering problem are NP-hard [4]. Various graph-theoretical approaches employing heuristics have been suggested [1,4,6,7].",1

The motivation of our work is the visualization of routes in road networks as sketches for driving directions. An important property of a route sketch is that it focuses on road changes and important landmarks rather than exact geography and distances. Typically the start and destination lie in populated areas that are locally reached via a sequence of relatively short road segments. On the other hand, the majority of the route typically consists of long highway segments with no or only few road changes. This property makes it difficult to display driving directions for the whole route in a single traditional map since some areas require much smaller scales than others. The strength of route sketches for this purpose is that they are not drawn to scale but rather use space proportionally to the route complexity.",1

It is known that each plane graph can be drawn in such a way in a (nxe2x88x922)xc3x97(nxe2x88x922) grid (for nxe2x89xa53), and that no grid smaller than (2n/3xe2x88x921)xc3x97(2n/3xe2x88x921) can be used for this purpose, if n is a multiple of 3.

While in traditional orthogonal layouts every edge is made of a sequence of axis-aligned line segments, in smooth orthogonal layouts every edge is made of axis-aligned segments and circular arcs with common tangents. Our goal is to create such layouts with low edge complexity, measured by the number of line and circular arc segments. We show that every biconnected 4-planar graph has a smooth orthogonal layout with edge complexity 3. If the input graph has a complexity-2 traditional orthogonal layout, we can transform it into a smooth complexity-2 layout.

Weak proximity drawings are straight line drawings such that if the proximity region of two points p and q representing vertices is devoid of other points representing vertices, then segment ( p , q ) is allowed, but not forced, to appear in the drawing. This differs from the usual, strong, notion of proximity drawing in which such segments must appear in the drawing. Most previously studied proximity regions are associated with a parameter xcexb2 , 0 xe2xa9xbd xcexb2 xe2xa9xbd xe2x88x9e . For fixed xcexb2 , weak xcexb2 -drawability is at least as expressive as strong xcexb2 -drawability, as a strong xcexb2 -drawing is also a weak one. We give examples of graph families and xcexb2 values where the two notions coincide, and a situation in which it is NP-hard to determine weak xcexb2 -drawability. On the other hand, we give situations where weak proximity significantly increases the expressive power of xcexb2 -drawability: we show that every graph has, for all sufficiently small xcexb2 , a weak xcexb2 -proximity drawing that is computable in linear time, and we show that every tree has, for every xcexb2 less than 2, a weak xcexb2 -drawing that is computable in linear time.",1

An inherent issue with circular layouts is that the rigid restriction on node placement often gives rise to long edges and an overall dense drawing. We suggest here three independent, complementary techniques for lowering the density and improving the readability of circular layouts. First, a new algorithm is given for placing the nodes on the circle such that edge lengths are reduced. Second, we enhance the circular drawing style by allowing some of the edges to be routed around the exterior of the circle.

The aim of DAGView is to produce clear visualizations of directed acyclic graphs in which every edge and the potential existence of a path can be immediately spotted by the user. Several criteria that users identified as important in a layout are met, such as underlying grid, crossings and bends that appear perpendicular. The main algorithm is based on the layout of directed acyclic graphs but can be extended to handle directed graphs with cycles and undirected graphs, taking into account user preferences and/or constraints. Important tasks that are used in user studies are performed efficiently within the DAGView framework.",1

The objective of the system is to provide, automatically, an aesthetically pleasing visual layout for arbitrary directed graphs.

Generally, given a graph G, the task is to produce an ~sthetie drawing of G, one tha t accurately reflects the topological structure of G in a graphical form. Many versions of this problem have been considered, and there is a variety of techniques, algorithms, and software packages tha t are currently available. (See the survey in [BETT] for more information.) For planar graphs, we typically require that vertices are represented by points in the plane, and edges are drawn as non-intersecting straight-line segments between their endpoints. Additionally, we are often given a plane graph, that is a planar graph with a given planar embedding, represented comhinatorially by cyclic orderings of edges incident to all vertices. Then the drawing needs to be consistent with tha t given planar embedding, in the sense tha t for each vertex v, the given cyclic ordering of edges incident to v needs to be the same as their clockwise ordering in the drawing. In this paper we deal with the following version: given a plane graph G, we want to map its vertices into integer grid points in such a way that the edges between them can be drawn as straight, non-intersecting llne segments. The resulting drawing has to be consistent with the planar embedding of G. We call such mappings grid drawings. It has been proven that each plane graph has a straight-line drawing [Fa48, Wa36, St51], which implies tha t it also has a grid drawing, since we can approximate real vertex coordinates by *Department of Computer Science, University of Ca.liforaix, Riverside, CA 92521.

In this paper we describe a linear-time polynomial-volume algorithm that constructs a strictly-upward weak Gabriel drawing of any rooted tree with O(log n)-bit requirement. As a special case we describe a Gabriel drawing algorithm for binary trees which produces integer co-ordinates and n3-area representations. Finally, we show that an infinite class of graphs requiring exponential area, admits linear-volume Gabriel drawings. The latter result can also be extended to s-drawings, for any 1 < s < 2, and relative neighborhood drawings.",1

This idea is illustrated with four case studies. (1) How can we design a graph so that paths can be discerned? Recent results in the perception of contours can be applied to make paths easier to perceive in directed graphs. (2) Should we be displaying graphs in 3D or 2D space? Research suggests that larger graphs can be understood if stereo and motion parallax depth cues are available. (3) How can heterogeneous information structures be best represented? Experiments show using structured 3D shape primitives make diagrams that are easier to discover and remember. (4) How can causal relationships be displayed? Michotte's work on the perception of causality suggests that causal relationships can be represented using simple animations. The general point of these examples is that data visualization can become a science based on the mapping of data structures to visual representations. Scientific methods can be applied both in the development of theory and testing the value of different representations.,1

That proof is easily modified to apply to unit disk touching graphs as well. In this paper, we show how to generalize our earlier construction to accomodate disks whose size may differ. In particular, we prove that the recognition problems for both bounded-ratio disk intersection graphs and bounded-ratio disk touching graphs are also NP-hard.

In this paper, we consider the problem of drawing directed hypergraphs with (and without) port constraints, which cover multiple real-world graph drawing applications like data flow diagrams and electric schematics.n n Most existing algorithms for drawing hypergraphs with port constraints are adaptions of the framework originally proposed by Sugiyama et al. in 1981 for simple directed graphs. Recently, a practical approach for upward crossing minimization of directed graphs based on the planarization method was proposed [7]. With respect to the number of arc crossings, it clearly outperforms prior (mostly layering-based) approaches. We show how to adopt this idea for hypergraphs with given port constraints, obtaining an upward-planar representation (UPR) of the input hypergraph where crossings are modeled by dummy nodes.n n Furthermore, we present the new problem of computing an orthogonal upward drawing with minimal number of crossings from such an UPR, and show that it can be solved efficiently by providing a simple method.",1

Train switching problems have been studied in the context of permutation networks, i. e., permuting the cars of a train on a given railroad network [5]. The cars enter the network one at a time, some are stored temporarily in the network and the cars leave the network in the prescribed permutation. For the planarity test we use the metaphor of train switching in the context of graph layouts. In a graph layout the vertices are processed according to a total order, i. e., an ordering of the vertices, which is called linear layout. The edges are data items that are inserted to and removed from a given data structure. The vertices are processed in the order of the linear layout. At each vertex, at first all edges incident to preceding vertices are removed from the data structure and then all edges incident to succeeding vertices are inserted into the data structure. These operations must obey the principles of the underlying data structure, such as LIFO for a stack or FIFO for a queue. A graph G is a stack graph, i. e., has a stack layout, if and only if it is outerplanar, and it is a 2-stack graph if and only if it is a subgraph of a planar graph with a Hamiltonian cycle [3].",1

The constraints describe how subsets of objects are geometrically represented relative to each other. We require that each individual object be of fixed size throughout the algorithm, but we allow for each of these sizes to differ one from another.

Wood","A k-stack layout (respectively, k-queue layout) of a graph consists of a total order of the vertices, and a partition of the edges into k sets of non-crossing (non-nested) edges with respect to the vertex ordering. A k-track layout of a graph consists of a vertex k-colouring, and a total order of each vertex colour class, such that between each pair of colour classes no two edges cross. The stack-number (respectively, queue-number, track-number) of a graph G, denoted by sn(G) (qn(G), tn(G)) is the minimum k such that G has a k-stack (k-queue, k-track) layout. This paper studies stack, queue, and track layouts of graph subdivisions. It is known that every graph has a 3-stack subdivision. The best known upper bound on the number of division vertices per edge in a 3-stack subdivision of an n-vertex graph G is improved from $mathcal{O}({n m log} n) to mathcal{O}({n m log min}{sn(G), qn(G)})$. This result reduces the question of whether queue-number is bounded by stack-number to whether 3-stack graphs have bounded queue number. It is proved that every graph has a 2-queue subdivision, a 4-track subdivision, and a mixed 1-stack 1-queue subdivision. All these values are optimal for every non-planar graph. In addition, we characterise those graphs with k-stack, k-queue, and k-track subdivisions, for all values of k. The number of division vertices per edge in the case of 2-queue and 4-track subdivisions, namely $mathcal{O}({n m log}{sf qn}(G))$, is optimal to within a constant factor, for every graph G. Applications to 3D polyline grid drawings are presented. For example, it is proved that every graph G has a 3D polyline grid drawing with the vertices on a rectangular prism, and with $mathcal{O}({n m log}{sf qn}(G))$.",1

While real-world graphs tend to be large and dense, most of the earlier work on evaluating the impact of edge crossings utilizes relatively small graphs that are manually generated and manipulated. We study the effect on task performance of increased edge crossings in automatically generated layouts for graphs, from different datasets, with different sizes, and with different densities. The results indicate that increasing the number of crossings negatively impacts accuracy and performance time and that impact is significant for small graphs but not significant for large graphs.

A useful approach is to expand selected sections (foci) of the graph revealing details of subgraphs. If this expansion is maintained within the context of the entire graph, information is provided about how subgraphs are embedded in the overall structure. Often it is also desirable to realign these foci in order to facilitate the visual comparison of subgraphs. We have introduced a distortion-based viewing tool, three-dimensional pliable surface (3DPS) [1], which allows for multiple arbitrarily-shaped foci on a surface that can be manipulated by the viewer to control the level of detail contained within each region. This paper extends 3DPS to include the repositioning of foci so as to bring together spatially separated regions for the purpose of comparison while retaining the effect of detail in context viewing. The significance of this approach is that it utilizes precognitive perceptual cues about the three-dimensional surface to make the distortions comprehensible, and allows the user to interactively control the location, shape, and extent of the distortion in very large graphs.",1

We consider the analogous three-dimensional problem, and prove that the maximum number of points in the nxc3x97 nxc3x97 n grid with no three collinear is xcex98(n2). This result is generalised by the notion of a 3D drawing of a graph.

Note that edges may cross. A 3D drawing of a complete graph Kn is nothing more than a set of n gridpoints with no three collinear. A slight generalisation of our first result is that the minimum volume for a 3D drawing of Kn is xcex98(n3/2). This compares favourably to xcex98(n3) when edges are not allowed to cross. Generalising the construction for Kn, we prove that every k-colourable graph on n vertices has a 3D drawing with $mathcal{O}(nsqrt{k})$ volume.

In addition, the tree depth is O(log n), and its construction takes O(n log n) time, where n is the number of points. We show that the BAR tree can be used to recursively divide a graph into subgraphs of roughly equal size, such that the drawing of each subgraph has a balanced aspect ratio. As a result, we obtain a representation of a graph as a collection of O(log n) layers, where each succeeding layer represents the graph in an increasing level of detail. The overall running time of the algorithm is O(n log n m D0(G)), where n and n are the number of vertices and edges of the graph G, and D0(G) is the time it takes to obtain an initial embedding of G.

Then we present a mixed-integer program (MIP) which always finds a drawing that fulfills all hard constraints (if such a drawing exists) and optimizes a weighted sum of costs corresponding to the soft constraints. We also describe some heuristics that speed up the MIP. We have implemented both the MIP and the heuristics. We compare their output to that of previous algorithms for drawing metro maps and to official metro maps drawn by graphic designers.",1

Kobourov, Carola Wenk","In this paper, we introduce the problem of drawing with xe2x80x9cfatxe2x80x9d edges. Traditionally, graph drawing algorithms represent vertices as circles and edges as closed curves connecting the vertices. In this paper we consider the problem of drawing graphs with edges of variable thickness. The thickness of an edge is often used as a visualization cue, to indicate importance, or to convey some additional information. We present a model for drawing with fat edges and a corresponding polynomial time algorithm that uses the model. We focus on a restricted class of graphs that occur in VLSI wire routing and show how to extend the algorithm to general planar graphs. We show how to take an arbitrary wire routing and convert it into a homotopic equivalent routing such that the distance between any two wires is maximized. Moreover, the routing uses the minimum length wires. Maximizing the distance between wires is equivalent to finding the drawing in which the edges are drawn as thick as possible. To the best of our knowledge this is the first algorithm that finds the maximal distance between any two wires and allows for wires of variable thickness. The previous best known result for the corresponding decision problem with unit wire thickness is the algorithm of Gao et al., which runs in O(kn 2 log(kn)) time and uses O(kn 2) space, where n is the number of wires and k is the maximum of the input and output complexities. The running time of our algorithm is O(kn n 3) and the space required is O(kn). The algorithm generalizes naturally to general planar graphs as well.",1

Polar coordinates allow us to specify different vertex resolution, bend-point resolution and edge separation. We first describe a standard (Cartesian) representation algorithm (CRA) which we then modify to obtain a polar representation algorithm (PRA). In both algorithms we are concerned with the following drawing criteria: angular resolution, bends per edge, vertex resolution, bend-point resolution, edge separation, and drawing area. The CRA algorithm achieves 1 bend per edge, unit vertex and bend resolution, ( sqrt 2 /2) edge separation, ( 5n times tfrac{{5n}} {2}) drawing area and ( tfrac{1} {{2d(psilon )}}) angular resolution, where d(v) is the degree of vertex v.

2125120113,23906,Techniques for Interactive Graph Drawing,2002-08-26,0,1,1191926394,,2002,Graph Drawing (GD),James Arvo,"There are two complementary approaches to graph drawing: algorithmic and interactive. By algorithmic graph drawing we mean the automatic placement of vertices and routing of edges using heuristics to improve understandability. Interactive graph drawing, on the other hand, implies that a user directly influences at least some low-level aspects of graph layout, either by direct placement of vertices and edges, or by providing some form of feedbackto the system.Interactively engaging the user is in some instances unavoidable. When a user desires a difficult-to-quantify aesthetic quality of the graph, or is incrementally constructing a graph (such as a state diagram for an automaton) as part of a problem-solving taskor pedagogical exercise, it is difficult or impossible to employ algorithmic graph drawing. In these instances it is more natural to employ a sketching metaphor in which a user draws the graph in a traditional sense.A common strategy for making interactive drawing of diagrams immediately understandable is to incorporate physical analogies; that is, to mimic some familiar real-world appearance or process. For example, the hand-drawn appearance of a diagram can be retained by preserving its unevenness and through the use of textures that impart the appearance of physical writing implements, such as pencil, ink, or chalk. It can be advantageous to retain this type of appearance in situations where userdrawn and computer-drawn diagrams coexist.The behavior of a graph that is interactively altered can also incorporate useful physical metaphors. For example, the edges adjacent to a vertex that is interactively re-positioned by a user can mimic physical linkages that stretch when pulled, and bend or contract when pushed. Such behaviors are natural in that they are almost immediately plausible and predictable to a user. However, not all interactive techniques can benefit from physical metaphors, for some transcend the capabilities of physical media. For example, recognition of hand-drawn elements, such as those representing vertices and edges, are often combined with gradual morphing that can improve the appearance of the diagram. Since physical writing surfaces exhibit no analogous behavior, a spectrum of possibilities has been explored. One approach that has been successfully applied in the context of graph drawing is the approach known as fluid sketching in which drawing and morphing occur nearly simultaneously.There are many potential combinations of algorithmic and interactive graph drawing to explore, such as the graceful re-routing of edges as a user interactively re-positions a vertex, or systems in which a user modifies automatically generated graphs, or in which local improvements are automatically applied to user-drawn graphs.",1

In this paper we consider optimization problems on RELs and show how to find optimal or near-optimal RELs for various quality criteria. Furthermore, we give upper and lower bounds on the number of RELs.",1

In order to achieve aesthetically pleasing results, we use grid and circular placement techniques, and utilize an appropriate modification of a well-known spring embedder algorithm. It turns out, that for some classes of graphs, our algorithm runs in O(nm) time, while in general, the running time is bounded in terms of the processing time of the spring embedder algorithm.

The idea of partial edge drawings (PED) is to drop the middle part of edges and rely on the remaining edge parts called stubs. We focus on a symmetric model (SPED) that requires the two stubs of an edge to be of equal length. In this way, the stub at the other endpoint of an edge assures the viewer of the edge's existence. We also consider an additional homogeneity constraint that forces the stub lengths to be a given fraction xcexb4 of the edge lengths (xcexb4-SHPED). Given length and direction of a stub, this model helps to infer the position of the opposite stub.n n We show that, for a fixed stub---edge length ratio xcexb4, not all graphs have a xcexb4-SHPED.

Geometric simultaneous embedding is a current topic in graph drawing and positive and negative results are known for various classes of graphs. So far only connected graphs have been considered. In this paper we present the first results for the setting where one of the graphs is a matching.n n In particular, we show that there exists a planar graph and a matching which do not admit a geometric simultaneous embedding. This generalizes the same result for a planar graph and a path. On the positive side, we describe algorithms that compute a geometric simultaneous embedding of a matching and a wheel, outerpath, or tree. Our proof for a matching and a tree sheds new light on a major open question: do a tree and a path always admit a geometric simultaneous embedding? Our drawing algorithms minimize the number of orientations used to draw the edges of the matching. Specifically, when embedding a matching and a tree, we can draw all matching edges horizontally. When embedding a matching and a wheel or an outerpath, we use only two orientations.",1

Providing the complete link information between related nodes in a graph can lead to visual clutter caused by many edge crossings. To reduce visual clutter, we draw only partial links. Then, the question arises if such diagrams are still readable, understandable, and interpretable. As a step toward answering this question, we conducted a controlled user experiment with 42 participants to uncover differences in accuracy and completion time for three different tasks: identifying the existence of a direct link, the existence of an indirect connection with one intermediate node, and the node with the largest number of outgoing edges. Furthermore, we compared tapered and traditional edge representations, three different graph sizes, and six different link lengths. In all configurations, the nodes of the graph were placed according to the force-directed layout by Fruchterman and Reingold. One result of this study is that the characteristics of completion times and error rates depend on the type of task. A general observation is that partially drawn links can lead to shorter task completion times, which occurs for nearly all graph sizes, tasks, and both tapered and traditional edge representations. In contrast, there is a tendency toward higher error rates for shorter links, which in fact is task-dependent.",1

Thus, in recent years, the field of security visualization has emerged to provide novel ways to display security-related information so that it is easier to understand. In this work, we give a preliminary survey of approaches to the visualization of computer security concepts that use graph drawing techniques.",1

In this setting we prove that every planar graph on n vertices admits a planar monotone drawing with at most two bends per edge and with at most 4n --- 10 bends in total; such a drawing can be computed in linear time and requires polynomial area. We also show that two bends per edge are sometimes necessary on a linear number of edges of the graph.

We show that any tree can be realized as the Delaunay graph of its embedded vertices. Particularly, a weighted tree can be embedded such that the weight on each edge is realized as the hyperbolic distance between its embedded vertices.

The distance distortion between non adjacent vertices can be made arbitrarily small --- less than a (1e) factor for any given e. Existing results on low distortion of embedding discrete metrics into trees carry over to hyperbolic metric through this result. The Delaunay character implies useful properties such as guaranteed greedy routing and realization as minimum spanning trees.",1

We can separate dcr and gcr for single-vertex graphs with embedding schemes, but it is not clear whether the separating example can be extended into separations on simple graphs. Finally, we show that if a graph can be embedded in a surface with crosscaps, then it has an embedding in that surface in which every edge passes through each crosscap at most twice. This implies that dcr is $$mathrm {mathbf {NP}}$$-complete.",1

The problem of computing a point-set embedding of G on P is NP-complete in xe2x84x9d2, even when G is 2-outerplanar and the points are in general position.

A rectangular dual is sliceable if it can be recursively subdivided along horizontal or vertical lines. A graph is rectangular if it has a rectangular dual and sliceable if it has a sliceable rectangular dual. There is a clear characterization of rectangular graphs. However, a full characterization of sliceable graphs is still lacking. The currently best result Yeap and Sarrafzadeh, 1995 proves that all rectangular graphs without a separating 4-cycle are sliceable. In this paper we introduce a recursively defined class of graphs and prove that these graphs are precisely the nonsliceable graphs with exactly one separating 4-cycle.",1

We quantify strength of bundling in a flexible pairwise fashion between edges, and among bundled edges, we quantify how dissimilar their colors should be by dissimilarity of their origins and destinations. We solve the resulting nonlinear optimization, which is also interpretable as a novel dimensionality reduction task. In large graphs the necessary compromise is whether to differentiate colors sharply between locally occurring strongly bundled edges (xe2x80x9clocal bundlesxe2x80x9d), or also between the weakly bundled edges occurring globally over the graph (xe2x80x9cglobal bundlesxe2x80x9d); we allow a user-set global-local tradeoff.

Given a directed graph (G=(V,A)) and a maximal height, we propose a layering approach that minimizes a weighted sum of the number of reversed arcs, the arc lengths, and the width of the drawing. We call this the Compact Generalized Layering Problem (CGLP). Here, the width of a drawing is defined as the maximum sum of the number of vertices placed on a layer and the number of dummy vertices caused by arcs traversing the layer. The CGLP is (mathcal {NP})-hard. We present two MIP models for this problem. The first one (EXT) is our extension of a natural formulation for directed acyclic graphs as suggested by Healy and Nikolov. The second one (CGL) is a new formulation based on partial orderings. Our computational experiments on two benchmark sets show that the CGL formulation can be solved much faster than EXT using standard commercial MIP solvers. Moreover, we suggest a variant of CGL, called MML, that can be seen as a heuristic approach. In our experiments, MML clearly improves on CGL in terms of running time while it does not considerably increase the average arc lengths and widths of the layouts although it solves a slightly different problem where the dummy vertices are not taken into account.",1

Keywords : territorial brand, regional branding, tourism destination . This paper shows the features of spatial development of branding in various regions of the Russian Federation. The ways of development and promotion of territorial brands both in large and in small towns of Russia were considered. Based on the description of a large number of Russian regional brands, the paper presents a comparative analysis and shows their advantages and disadvantages. Much attention is paid to the formation processes of territorial brands on the example of the Republic of Tatarstan. The paper describes the main objectives of the Visit Tatarstan brand and the features of its visual style. It was shown that the visual style of this brand is based on a modern interpretation of ethnic, historical and traditional Tatar ornaments covering thousands of years. Among the main tasks of the Visit Tatarstan brand is the formation of a clear, uniform and an adequate image of the Republic of Tatarstan in the public consciousness both within and beyond the region.

Shakurova,"This article discusses some mechanisms for the stereotype development on television. It is known that television has much more opportunities and ways of conveying the meaning, and its impact on the audience is more effective than that of the print media. This, in turn, leads to large volumes and depth of representation of various cognitive signs of a stereotype, and a high degree of impact on the television audience. We have used the content analysis to study the news programs of Russian channels ""Pervyi Kanal"", ""Rossiya 24"", ""NTV"". This article presents only some of the conclusions drawn by us. In particular, we drew attention to the fact that the stereotype fixation occurs due to the accumulation of a large volume of certain information. And a stereotype change requires that this information contrasts sharply with the already existing stereotypes. We have traced whether such processes are taking place on Russian television on the example of the European migration crisis. In our opinion, the Russian television has not accumulated sharply contrasting information for the period under study. However, we noticed that information about migrants contained stereotyped settings. At the same time, the cognitive, affective and behavioral components were clearly distinguished in the stereotypes, and the information itself was given dynamically and cyclically",1

This problem with subgraph isomorphism as a special case has extra challenges when we consider matching complex networks exhibiting the small world phenomena.

This is then used to define similarity of a pair of nodes in two networks respectively, which is the crucial step of network alignment. Specifically, the Ricci curvature of an edge describes intuitively how well the local neighborhood is connected. The graph Ricci flow uniformizes discrete Ricci curvature and induces a Ricci flow metric that is insensitive to node/edge insertions and deletions. With the new metric, we can map a node in (G_1) to a node in (G_2) whose distance vector to only a few preselected landmarks is the most similar. The robustness of the graph metric makes it outperform other methods when tested on various complex graph models and real world network data sets (Emails, Internet, and protein interaction networks) (The source code of computing Ricci curvature and Ricci flow metric are available: https://github.com/saibalmars/GraphRicciCurvature).",1

Se procedio a realizar el trabajo de campo entre el abril y mayo de 2017 y se utilizo un cuaderno de campo para el registro de la informacion, la muestra fue compuesta por 15 participantes que cumplieron criterios de elegibilidad. Las mujeres en situacion de prostitucion atendidas por la ONG proceden de entornos de pobreza estructural, lugares donde faltan los recursos basicos, de lugares en conflicto o donde han sufrido violencia. No obstante, la prostitucion profundiza aun mas esta situacion. La condicion femenina marcada por la mala situacion economica se considero, en este estudio, como un determinante de la vulnerabilidad social evidenciado por factores asociados, como el uso de drogas, sometimiento a la pareja sexual, la dependencia financiera y economica y la cuestion de la supervivencia. La vulnerabilidad programatica fue identificada en la falta de conocimiento de los programas de prevencion de Infeccion de Transmision Sexual, en los aspectos de la maternidad y la salud reproductiva y el impacto del diagnostico del VIH. A partir de los resultados de ese estudio, se puede observar la necesidad de crear programas de prevencion y promocion teniendo en cuenta la vulnerabilidad social, que incluyan intervencion en solucion de problemas y estrategias de afrontamiento.",1

In recent years, image-based techniques have emerged as a strong competitor in the arena of solutions for this task. While many papers on this topic have been published, the precise advantages and limitations of such techniques, and also how they relate to similar techniques in the more traditional fields of scientific visualization (scivis) and image processing, have not been sufficiently outlined. In this paper, we aim to provide such an overview and comparison. We highlight the main advantages of image-based graph visualization and propose a simple taxonomy for such techniques. Next, we highlight the differences between graph and scivis/image datasets that lead to limitations of current image-based graph visualization techniques. Finally, we consider these limitations to propose a number of future work directions for extending the effectiveness and range of image-based graph visualization.",1

The objective of the system is to provide, automatically, an aesthetically pleasing visual layout for arbitrary directed graphs. The prototype has shown the strengths of this approach. The innovative strategy of clan-based graph decomposition is the first digraph drawing technique to analyse locality in the graph in two dimensions. The typical approach to drawing digraphs uses a single dimension, level, to arrange the nodes.",1

La actuacion y desarrollo de las mujeres en el trabajo y en la politica crean un marco de proteccion y respeto para ellas. Actualmente las mujeres participan de manera activa en la economia de las familias; ahora ellas crean sus propios micros negocios y ya muchas madres ademas de encargarse de la familia se desenvuelven de manera independiente; esto no debe verse desde el punto de vista del feminismo y del machismo, sino desde la optica de la igualdad entre mujer y hombre. Dejemos atras los estereotipos en la que se basaban en la antiguedad mujeres y hombres y busquemos el poder sobresalir adelante como una sociedad justa.",1

Necessarily drawings \(\varGamma _I\) and \(\varGamma _O\) must be equivalent, that is, there exists a homeomorphism of the plane that transforms \(\varGamma _I\) into \(\varGamma _O\). Van Goethem and Verbeek use O(n) linear morphs, where n is the maximum complexity of the input drawings. However, if the graph is disconnected their method requires \(O(n^{1.5})\) linear morphs. In this paper we present a refined version of their approach that allows us to also morph between two planar orthogonal drawings of a disconnected graph with O(n) linear morphs while preserving planarity, orthogonality, and linear complexity of the intermediate drawings. We describe an algorithm that morphs between two planar orthogonal drawings xcex93ixcex93iGamma_i and xcex93oxcex93oGamma_o of a graph GGG, while preserving planarity and orthogonality. Necessarily xcex93ixcex93iGamma_i and xcex93oxcex93oGamma_o share the same combinatorial embedding. Our morph uses a linear number of horizontal and vertical linear morphs (linear interpolations between two drawings) and preserves linear complexity throughout the process, thereby answering an open question from Biedl et. al. Our algorithm first unifies the two drawings to ensure an equal number of (virtual) bends on each edge. We then interpret bends as vertices which form obstacles for so-called wires: horizontal and vertical lines separating the vertices of xcex93oxcex93oGamma_o. These wires define homotopy classes with respect to the vertices of GGG (for the combinatorial embedding of GGG shared by xcex93ixcex93iGamma_i and xcex93oxcex93oGamma_o). These homotopy classes can be represented by orthogonal polylines in xcex93ixcex93iGamma_i. We argue that the structural difference between the two drawings can be captured by the emph{spirality} of the wires in xcex93ixcex93iGamma_i, which guides our morph from xcex93ixcex93iGamma_i to xcex93oxcex93oGamma_o.",1

We found that generally both interaction techniques increase accuracy, sometimes at the cost of longer completion times, and that the highlighting outclasses the stability adjustment for many tasks except the most complex ones.",1

Methods: A case-control study of 551 randomly selected older adults, all aged 60 and above including 180 demented and 371 nondemented retirees, pair matched for education and gender, was conducted. We evaluated the adjusted associations between dementia risk and the probable occupational and environmental variables through multiple logistic regression.Results: A history of exposure to air pollution (Adjusted OR=2.00, 95%CI= 1.00-7.00), head injuries (Adjusted OR=2.00, 95%CI= 1.00-6.00) and more than 20 years of work in the operational fields (Adjusted OR=5.00, 95%CI= 3.00-8.00) was significantly correlated with an increased risk of dementia.

Nurullina, Tao Yuan, Liliya A. Usmanova","The article deals with the modal words with the meaning of the possibility in the translation aspect from Russian to Chinese. The attention is focused on the ways of possibility modality expression in the linguistic corps of the languages being studied. The relevance of this work is determined by the fact that it relies on a contrastive description of the linguistic facts of Russian and Chinese languages and is carried out in line with the modern comparative-typological approach to the study of modal words with the meaning of possibility. The article attempts to study the modal words with the meaning of possibility in the framework of Russian-Chinese translation. In order to determine the features of possibility modality translation, the following studies were carried out: 1) the modal words with the possibility value were divided into four types; 2) the search was performed for the correspondence of words and word combinations in a parallel corpus. The scientific work also presented an experimental study, which allows us to conclude that each type of modal words shows different conformity trends in translation: zero correspondence, correspondence and compensation. The quantitative analysis shows that the Russian-Chinese translation of modal words shows the tendency to full correspondence in a greater extent, which is primarily conditioned by similar semantic relations (the reflection of an utterance logical evaluation), expressed by modal words in both studied languages. It should be noted that such factors as the diachronic feature of the Chinese language, stylistics, the acceptance and the non-acceptance of Russian language features influence the translation of modal words with the meaning of possibility from Russian to Chinese",1

In the course of the study, groups of narrators were identified, their roles in the development of the plot were defined, and their narrative strategies were formulated. A consistent study of the implementation of the strategy led to a general conclusion about which strategy is leading and decisive for this type of reality show. Identification of narrative strategies allows you to expand the boundaries of potential project changes in the future, and also stimulates the search for optimal ways to implement various television functions, including regulatory, social and educational, and others",1

The level of sustainable functioning of regional socio-economic systems is a key factor affecting the socioeconomic development of the Russian economy in the face of increasing uncertainty in the external environment. This requires new approaches to identify tools for new governmental management at the meso level, to developing new forms and models for sustainable socio-economic development of regions. The paper substantiates the thesis that the necessary condition for the implementation of sustainable development of the regional economic system is the presence of adapters in its elements that provide a certain quality of management decisions. Regional development is aimed at achieving a set of parameters that meet the needs of economic agents: residents and non-residents of the regional economy, subject to feasibility of management decision, compliance with strategic guidelines for regional development and reducing agency costs. At the same time, regional development is interpreted as the result of structural changes (the synthesis of structure and processes) in the system of interaction between subjects of socioeconomic relations at the meso level, and controlling is considered as a tool for effective management of innovation changes",1

The weaknesses on the private side of the contract are not always in the public interest, and exacerbating this situation can lead to a weakening of the private sector and ultimately to the general economy of countries. Therefore, lawyers and economists have come up with ways to protect it from the weak side of government contracts. The fruit of weak support in government transactions is to balance the benefits of executing and executing these contracts and thereby achieve public goals while strengthening and safeguarding the interests of the private sector. One of the most effective ways of supporting the weak side is to create a framework that compensates for non-compliance with the principle of equity in government transactions and provides grounds for fair private sector growth and development. The most important of these contexts are the implementation of the principles of transparency, competition and objective criteria in decision making. In this article, while outlining these principles in relation to government contracts, we will study the role of adherence to each of these principles in protecting the weak side in government contracts.",1

It has been revealed that the most productive affixation means of the usual innovations generation comprise the following: suffixation, prefixation, zero-suffixation and affixation-like word formation, wherein the most popular one is suffixation. At the present stage of the Russian language development we witness an increase in adaptive function of word formation types. Joining native Russian affixes to the borrowed stems appears to be one the most productive patterns in the contemporary usual affixation word building, where suffixation is the most demanding one. The research results obtained can contribute to the development of the lexical derivatology, lexical semantics, neology, and language stylistics problems.

One of the most significant current global trends is the high level of mobility of people - from tourism to growing working migration. Relocation of people, mixture of ethnic groups and nationalities have taken place in all epochs of the history of humanity but it has never been so grand-scale, that is including absolutely all continents. The development of transport, information technologies have simplified people’s relocation, including with educational purposes. Such state of things has identified multiculturalism as a separate branch of pedagogical theory and practice. Russia is a multicultural state that has formed a corresponding system of education as the foundation of national culture, outlook, based on variety of cultures, languages, traditions. Modern challenges of social development formulate a sophisticated task of up-bringing in the spirit of deep respect to all nations, the ability to communicate and cooperate with people of various nationalities, social groups, religions. Among the multitude of tasks of multicultural education, connected with designing of its contents, the most important from our point of view is the up-bringing of a multiculturally orientated personality. Multiculturally orientated personality possesses civic self-actualization, means of creative self-organization and self- realization in the multicultural world. It must possess key general competences, including the knowledge of basics and objective laws of the development of multicultural world, the ability to orientate in the cultural multi-variety of the world. The major role in solution of the task is given to studying geography, shaping geographic culture. Geoculturalistic agenda, various aspects of studying geography has very deep roots. Geography is tensely connected with the idea of culture. Culture is territorial, that is it experiences full-scaled influence of geographic factor, it is differentiated in space, and is organized in a very special way, developing and functioning in specific, immanent territorial forms. Besides, teaching geography at school does not correspond to the current demands to full extent. In secondary school, especially in city, geography is taught only in specialized classes which obviously diminish the opportunities of developing multiculturual environment to full scale. These and many other aspects of shaping geographic culture of students are realized on bachelor degree course and master course in institutions of higher education. Thus, the development of geographic culture, advance of geographic education should become the important part in solution the problems of multicultural education and multicultural preparation of specialists.",1

Therefore, the formation of a court of arbitration and the issuance of a ruling requires that the existence and the validity of the contract of referral the matter to arbitration is acceptable to the parties. Although the parties may find a dispute (difference) in the existence and validity of the arbitration agreement, it is also likely that one of the parties denies or invalidates the existence of the arbitration agreement. In such a hypothesis, the formation of an arbitration authority and its review will entail consideration of the dispute before it. For this reason, one of the important issues that may arise in arbitration is the determination of the competent authority dealing with a dispute that may arise between the parties as to the existence or validity of the arbitration convention or jurisdiction. The issue of competency assessment (Competence - Competence), which improves the efficiency of the arbitral institution, can be seen in the most legal systems.

PED draws a link, which is a partial visual representation of an edge, and reduces visual clutter of the node-link diagram. However, more time is required to read a PED to infer undrawn parts. The authors propose a morphing edge drawing (MED), which is a PED that changes with time. In MED, links morph between partial and complete drawings; thus, a reduced load for estimation of undrawn parts in a PED is expected. Herein, a formalization of MED is shown based on a formalization of PED. Then, requirements for the scheduling of morphing are specified. The requirements inhibit morphing from crossing and shorten the overall time for morphing the edges. Moreover, an algorithm for a scheduling method implemented by the authors is illustrated and the effectiveness of PED from a reading time viewpoint is shown through an experimental evaluation.",1

In the context of rectilinear drawings, the problem is trivial. For pseudolinear drawings, the existence of such an extension follows from Levi’s enlargement lemma. In contrast, we prove that deciding if a given set of edges can be inserted into a simple drawing is \(\mathsf {NP}\)-complete. Moreover, we show that the maximization version of the problem is \(\mathsf {APX}\)-hard. We also present a polynomial-time algorithm for deciding whether one edge uv can be inserted into D(G) when \(\{u,v\}\) is a dominating set for the graph G.",1

Most standard graph drawing algorithms optimize one of these criteria which may lead to layouts that are deficient in other criteria. We introduce an optimization framework, Stress-Plus-X (SPX), that simultaneously optimizes stress together with several other criteria: edge crossings, minimum crossing angle, and upwardness (for directed acyclic graphs). SPX achieves results that are close to the state-of-the-art algorithms that optimize these metrics individually. SPX is flexible and extensible and can optimize a subset or all of these criteria simultaneously. Our experimental analysis shows that our joint optimization approach is successful in drawing graphs with good performance across readability criteria.",1

Legislative registration as a state recognition of the rights of ethnic minorities is a prerequisite for combating discrimination and, at the same time, protecting small groups of people. Therefore, the policy in the field of these rights is a socially significant reality recognized today by the international community. It is the result of ethnosocial consensus. The assertion that the political rights of ethnic minorities are universally recognized is often accompanied by arguments based on modern international norms.

Currently, a robot can replace a lawyer only in execution of programmable routine tasks, such as drawing up a simple template contracts, claims, search for court practice materials, analytical information, transfer documents to the court, etc. But at the same time, artificial intelligence cannot compete with the human in the issues of a comprehensive analysis of a particular problem; in giving an assessment of the fairness and honesty of the person who has applied. The field of law cannot be translated into a programming language due to the variety of terms, categories and differences in their interpretation by sectors; law has no clear boundaries and framework. High-quality professional legal activity is possible only with the participation of a professional lawyer with experience in this field.

Isavnin, Anton N. Karamyshev","In economics, the general theory is largely descriptive, and mathematical models are not only statistical but also partial. Therefore, an economic phenomenon usually requires using partial methods and getting only private solutions limited by particular conditions - the type of activity, its place and time of implementation. The real idea of the nature of the economic phenomenon that interests us is given only by statistical data. Correlation analysis is a time-consuming and completely non-formalizable task when it is necessary to justify the relationship structure of a large number of factors. In addition, the quality and interpretation of the results of statistical analysis are predetermined by the nature of the statistical models used to obtain sample estimates of their parameters. Due to the complexity of multidimensional statistical models, general theoretical concepts are usually limited by the assumption that the sampled data does not contradict the normal multidimensional distribution law. This greatly simplifies multivariate statistical analysis and therefore it always leads to linear regression relationships, which corresponds to a trivial system of correlation relationships and is rarely observed in reality. The structure of each economic object is unique, therefore, it is proposed to refine it using a system of correlation matrices of various orders. It is shown that the generalization of large volumes of multidimensional sample data in the form of “portraits” of correlation matrices clearly represents the specific features of the object of study. Moreover, the empirical system of statistically significant relationships is transformed into the corresponding model of economic relationships.

International legal control is one of the means of ensuring the fulfillment by the states of their obligations and is important in achieving the effectiveness of the implementation of legal norms. The paper analyzes the relevant provisions of two international legal acts that constitute the legal basis in anti-doping activities: The Anti-Doping Convention of the Council of Europe and the International Convention against Doping in Sport. In accordance with the provisions of international legal acts, special monitoring bodies are established to monitor the implementation by the states of their obligations through online questionnaires. The focus is on the activities of these specialized agencies. At the same time, the nature of international legal control is not limited only to checking the behavior of states, but also is expressed in the prevention of violations of the international law. In this regard, it is needed an element that establishes the responsibility of states for failure to fulfill their international obligations. Such a mechanism would be the document Operational Guidelines and System of Consequences for Non-Compliance with the Regulations Adopted as Annex to the International Convention against Doping in Sport",1

Molotov, Alexey Sergeevich Katasev, Dina Vladimirovna Kataseva","This article solves the problem of constructing and evaluating a neural network model to determine the creditworthiness of individuals. It is noted that the most important part of the modern retail market is consumer lending. Therefore, an adequate and high-quality assessment of the creditworthiness of an individual is a key aspect of providing credit to a potential borrower. The theoretical and practical aspects of assessing the creditworthiness of individuals are considered. To solve this problem, the need for the use of intelligent modeling technologies based on neural networks is being updated. The construction of a neural network model required the receipt of initial data on borrowers. Using correlation analysis, 14 input parameters were selected that most significantly affect the output. The training and test data samples were generated to build and evaluate the adequacy of the neural network model. Training and testing of the neural network model was carried out on the basis of the analytical platform “Deductor”. Analysis of contingency tables to assess the accuracy of the neural network model in the training and test samples showed positive results. The error of the first kind on the data from the training sample was 0.45%, and the error of the second kind was 1.39%. Accordingly, the error of the first kind was not observed on the data from the test sample, and the error of the second kind was 2.68%. The results obtained indicate a high generalizing ability and adequacy of the constructed neural network, as well as the possibility of its effective practical use as part of intelligent decision support systems for granting loans to potential borrowers",1

Baryshev","The paper is devoted to the analysis of legal problems of ensuring competition in the field of housing and communal services. The paper studies the features of business relations in the market of housing and communal services. The Russian and foreign experience of law enforcement of competition is investigated. The authors propose ways to build an effective mechanism for the legal regulation of business activities in the field of housing and communal services. R.R. Izmailov believes that the presence of competition is a prerequisite for the effective functioning of the legal regulation mechanism for entrepreneurial activity in the field of housing and communal services. The authors conclude that the problems of improving the legal support of competition in the housing and communal services sector are due to a high level of historically established economic concentration in certain commodity markets, as well as a significant proportion of natural monopoly entities. It is noted that monopolistic activity in the sphere of housing and communal services can manifest itself in the form of abuse by an economic entity of its dominant position, as well as in the form of agreements and concerted actions. According to S.A. Baryshev, unfair competition as a type of activity prohibited by law can manifest itself in the field of housing and communal services in various forms. It is proposed to attract concessionaires as one of the ways to develop competition in the housing and communal services sector, including by transferring communal facilities to the management of private operators on the basis of concession agreements, as well as improving the procedure for determining tariff regulation in the housing sector.",1

The rationale for the modernization of auxiliary business processes is more problematic since their specific features significantly complicate the calculation of the economic effect. Firstly, there is a lack of information about the technologies for supporting auxiliary business processes. Secondly, the existing management tools do not consider the complex and closed nature of economic relations between supporting business processes. Thirdly, the complexity of assessing the quality of products of auxiliary business processes and their impact on the main business processes.

By strikingly combining and synthesizing real and fictional things, writer reaches the heights of satirical imagery. It should be noted that, judging by the satirical nature of his works, the intensity semantics (exaggeration or hyperbole) carries a strong importance, while the wide specter of hypotaxis-based sentences is used as a means of its realization. Syntactic units of idiomatic structure that express intensity-consequential, concession-amplification, temporal-concession and other relations are differentiated by their semantic diversity, merging of informative and connotative meanings, combination of real and surreal contents, combination of stable and variable components. The expressions created by the tak/takoj/nastol'ko/do togo/do takoj stepeni…chto; slishkom/chereschur…chtoby; chto (by) ni/kak (by) ni…a; uzh na chto…a; ne uspeet…a (kak); eshche ne..., a uzh scheme are related to the phrase models mentioned above. They are formed on the base of constant components that make up sentence’s carcass, which provides free lexical filling. Meanwhile, the sphere of relational meanings is complicated by the modus-expressive meanings. Semantics of contrast, unusualness, suddenness (subjective hyperbolization that does not match the objective state of affairs, combining of incompatible, shift of moral orientations, combination of real and potential plans etc.) contributes to the appearance of the comical or sarcastic effect. In the functional and textual aspect, the analyzed phrase models become the leading means of presenting speaker’s position in the comprehension of world’s moral picture",1

With the intensification of cooperation and the expansion of intercultural contacts between China and Russia, the concept Китай (Kitaj) continues to be actively developed in modern Russian, enriched with new meanings and new forms of expression of these meanings via derivation. Against this background, the formation of a scientific image of the family of words with Китай (Kitaj) seems necessary and relevant, primarily from the standpoint of the derivational-semantic approach. The present paper considers more than 50 words that are included in the family of words with Китай (Kitaj), which are lexicalized in the Russian word-formation dictionary by A.N. Tikhonov (28 units) and Internet resources (23 units). The article analyzes the word-formation structure of these words, reveals their semantic features, considers derivational relations between the units of the family, determines a set of word-formation categories that are realized in this family.

Nazarova, Lilia R. Nizameeva, Gérard Broussois","The comprehension of admirativeness as an independent category took place relatively recently – at the end of the 20th century. Until now, some scholars have not recognized an independent character of admirative. However, in recent years there has been an increasingly noticeable tendency to recognize the separate role of admirativeness and to indicate that the expression of surprise evoked by unexpected information cannot be combined with similar meanings. At the same time, the ways and degree of expression of admirativeness in different language systems vary significantly. The introduction of such grammatical category as admirativeness and the term “admirative” refers to the second half of the 19th century. In 1879, O. Dozon coined the term in his works on the Albanian language. The choice of this name (Fr. admiratif comes from the verb “to admire”) is determined by the fact that the linguist interpreted the concept as a certain sense of admiration or surprise, often having an ironic character. Further the development of this direction showed that admirative had the meaning of surprise rather than admiration. In this connection, in 1997, S. de Lancey first singled out this concept into a separate grammatical category. The scholar substantiates it by the fact that in a number of languages, such as Korean, Turkish, Tibetan, Dardic, Sanvar, etc., admirative has a separate grammatical expression. The identification of admirativeness as a separate linguistic phenomenon with a number of specific features has been still the subject of controversy among the researchers. Characteristics and distinctive features of admirativeness, allowing for the separation it from other similar categories will be considered later in the paper (Davletbaeva et al., 2013). In his writings, S. de Lancey uses the term “mirative”, thereby excluding its correlation with admiration introduced by O. Dozon from the meaning of the concept, and indicating that its primary function is to convey the subject’s astonishment. To date, the term “mirative” is widely used in English-language grammar. V.A. Plugnyan notes that the use of this term is more grounded from a typological point of view, however, the use of the concept “admirative” is often retained in domestic works (Smagina, 1996).",1

This period was not chosen by chance: in it, with the greatest strength and clarity, the leading trends in the development of Russian social (socio-philosophical) thought were identified, which had a direct and indirect influence on the literary process of the 19th century. In this transitional era, for certain reasons, objective conditions were created for the development of cornerstone ideological programs that became the subject of intellectual polemics, sometimes sharp and fierce, in subsequent times and which have not lost their relevance until now, as can be judged by modern book production, developing at the philosophical level, the most important questions of the future of Russia as a civilizational “mainland”, and on those very topical discussions that are conducted in the media space (television, no). One of the vivid exponents of this dispute was Petr Chaadaev, whose views on the cultural and civilizational identity of Russia were distinguished by a deep originality, which was in contrast with the official world outlook trends of the era. In the 1830–1850s, a discussion arose between “Slavophiles” and “Westerners”, which was also conducted on the pages of fiction. Due to this, a deprived of monolithic, rather contradictory picture of the perception of the West and the East as civilizational landmarks of the “Russian soul” has developed in the Russian consciousness. So, the East acted not only as a standard of high and refined culture, a role model, but also as a synonym for ignorance and inertness – all that is recorded in the capacious word meaning “Asian”. In the same way, the West was both a model of enlightenment and technocratic progress, and a kind of form of spiritual dependence associated with the decay and decay of the national. Such judgments were characteristic not only of the Russian society of the 1830–1850ss. In one form or another, they met in previous periods of Russian history, and in those countries of the world where the modernization process was coupled with the westernization of the cultural environment.",1

The foundations of the visual arts in animated typography, as in other arts, exist in the sense that if the text were to make a structural change, it would undermine its visual dimensions. Understanding the features and dimensions of Persian text in accordance with English text for the purpose of forming animated typography is one of the essentials for acquainting with the visual and visual principles of Persian animated typography. Understanding these rules is effective in creating powerful and dynamic compositions and prevents text alienation in the animation, text was not intrinsically animated, the next move being added to the text. Accordingly, it is necessary to know the principles and principles of animation. The general question of this research is whether from the visual arts perspective, the visual aspect of Persian writing has a place for use in the design of animated typography. If so, what are the differences and commonalities of Persian and English animated typography? This research is a comparative study based on the principles and principles of typography and deals with the similar function of animating English typography. The purpose of this study is to identify the diversity of Persian typography structures for animating and to compare their visual function with English animated typography in order to emphasize the existence of completely different possibilities in the creation of compositions in these two types of writing for animation. It is expected that the study of Persian and English typography and their function in animated layout conclude that attention should be given to the effect of how text is used, the types of face types and their function in the structure of Persian animated typography, as in English animated typography.

The task is to explain how corruptibility affects the generally recognized properties of the legal rules. The author describes the distortion of such properties of a “healthy” legal norm as formal certainty, general obligatoriness, systemic interconnection and provision with the state coercion power. We analyzed the “Methodology for conducting anti-corruption expertise of regulatory legal acts and draft regulatory legal acts” approved by the Government of the Russian Federation.

It is concluded that the primary textual uncertainty creates uncertainty in the consequences, destinations and systemic relationships of the corruptogenic norm, which is eliminated in the course of interaction between the corrupt person and the corrupt official.

Kairzhanov","The problem of the writer’s self-identification, especially of such a multifaceted one as Ravil Bukharayev, is closely connected with one of the topical problems of modern literary criticism and cultural studies – the problem of the Other. Ravil Raisovich Bukharayev (1951 - 2012) – a Tatar poet, writer, philosopher who wrote in Russian, lived for more than 20 years in England. In his work he demonstrates a new cultural situation, the ability to seamlessly apprehend the universal art culture, literature and worldview ideas from ancient times to the present day at the same time preserving his national and religious identity. The poetry by R. R. Bukharayev has repeatedly become the object of scientific research while the philosophical prose by R. R. Bukharayev is still waiting for his researcher. This article represents the experience of a scientific study of the artistic world of RR Bukharayev’s prose based on the example of his novel Letters to Another Room [1]. The results of our study suggest the following conclusions: The novel by R. R. Bukharayev “Letters to Another Room” presents the perception of England through the Other’s vision of it. R. R. Bukharayev representing himself as the Other in relation to the English tradition upends the preconceived idea of the English “gentleman” as the only bearer of the English literary and cultural tradition. Irony and self-irony help the narrator to isolate himself from Englishness of the created text: 1)The image of England in the novel by R. R. Bukharayev is ambiguous: on the one hand, the narrator found a real House with a wonderful garden, a place of rest and creativity in it, on the other – the author is far from idealizing English society. He seeks maximum objectivity in the artistic presentation of the image of England in his novel. 2)A distinctive feature of R. R. Bukharayev’s narrative is an integration of Russian and English realities in the text, which is manifested in comparisons of English everyday realities with memories of Russian life. In the minds of the author the images and associations connected with English and Russian literature and culture organically coexist.&#x0D;",1

The way out of the shadow of the self-employed people is one of the most discussed issues not only in Russia, but also in many countries of the world. The unwillingness to officially register their activities is explained, first of all, by the fact that the payment of taxes, as a rule, is incommensurable with the income of the self-employed people. At the same time, without registering their business, self-employed citizens are left without their social protection from the state, and without the opportunity to receive development loans, etc. The state should encourage self-employment people, as it contributes to solving the problem of unemployment. In the EU and the USA, the self-employed population provides business, social, real estate, intermediary services, as well as provides counselling, advertising, retail, franchising and other activities (over 400 types of activities).

Abikenova","The article is dedicated to the research of semantic word formation of verbs in the language space of Russian subdialects. From the point of cognitive linguistics, the semantic verb derivatives are observed in the system of subdialects. The analysis of several word-formative models is given and structural-semantic and paradigmatic relations between derivatives and inflections in the sphere of different dialect verb groups are described in this research. It is proven that, in the reviewed semantically derived dialect verbs, the subjective-evaluative connotation, usually of the negative nature, is present – from the cognitive aspect it is represented as one of the main features of derivative verb units. It is noted that such factors as the abilities to think and feel prompt the dialect carrier to create new words: dialect carrier’s ability to create new words signals about their language sense and constructive thinking. Semantic derivation enriches the dialect language not only with new lexemes, but also with new word-formative relations. Realization of such powerful potential of Russian dialects shows the independence of derivative processes in the dialectic word production. It is proven that the research of dialect vocabulary provides a great opportunity to generalize word-formative processes, including semantic verb derivation and a Russian national language on different evolution stages. Moreover, derivative processes are equally important for construction and understanding of language picture of the world as lexical-phraseological or stylistic phenomena.",1

Since methods and financial instruments are based on a theoretical basis, as well as on practical examples, their application and development are especially in demand. Therefore, the issue of cash flow management at Russian enterprises is relevant today.The paper explores current scientific discussions regarding the management of cash flows at an enterprise in Russia.

The main research methods include an analysis of literary sources, a pedagogical experience summary, observations, a discussion, data recording, and ranking. Primary school teachers are key figures and spiritual heritage broadcasters in the educational process. The ethnocultural competence of an education professional is increasingly important due to the development of new forms of information transformation and an increasing demand in modern society. Moreover, ethnocultural competence is an integral professional and personal characteristic that determines the willingness and ability to pursue ethnocultural education, national culture introduction to primary school students, and the formation of respect for and a positive, tolerant attitude toward other nations’ cultures. The term ethnoculture consists of the words “ethnos” and “culture,” which are equally interdependent. Culture is a compound, historically developed system of material, spiritual, and social expressions of human activity. It reflects how humans understand reality through its content, morphology, and functions. One of the main objectives of culture is to promote a positive attitude toward the ethnocultural differences that influence human development and self-realization. Ethnocultural education contributes to interethnic relations, protection, and development. In addition, it reveals the characteristics and spiritual and moral values of ethnic groups and impacts interethnic and interfaith communication among students. In this research, an ethnocultural training model for future teachers and students’ ethnocultural competence was developed and tested.

This has led to a specific sensitivity to how the two countries are approaching each other. Despite the importance of the two countries' relations, it is observed that in the history of the relations between Iran and Russia, various issues and issues have always been hindered by the close relations between the two countries. The beginning of Iran-Soviet relations during the Second Pahlavi era was accompanied by issues such as World War II and subsequent events. The relations between the two countries were influenced by the factors and system variables of the international system, such as the Cold War, the US-Soviet rivalry, the Second World War and the entry of the Allies into Iran, the deconstruction of the relations between the two post-Cold War superpowers, and so on.The main question of the current research is that the political relations between Iran and Russia influenced by the second Pahlavi period?To answer this question, the hypothesis was that Iran's political economic relations were fluctuating in the second Pahlavi era and influenced by the changing system theory of the international system with the Soviet Union. The findings suggest that various variables such as the structure of the international system and international events, including World War II, the arrival of controversial forces in Iran, the Cold War, the post-Cold War, the US and Soviet policies, and the variables such as the issue of oil Azerbaijan's autonomy, Tudeh's actions in Iran, the issue of fisheries and borders. Also, the policies adopted by Iranian politicians, including negative balance policy, positive nationalism and independent national policy, have affected Iran-Soviet relations. In a general conclusion, from 1320 (1942) to 1357 (1979), the relationship between Iran and Russia has been an upward trend towards peaceful coexistence.

In order to examine this problem, comparative analysis was chosen as the main research method. Through the exploration of international experience and comparing legal norms, repeating the same mistakes in the area of domestic law and judicial practice can be avoided. This approach also facilitates the assessment of the effectiveness of solving various problems of law enforcement associated with the institutions of marriage and as a consequence, family in modern society. Additionally, the authors employed some other general and private scientific methods. Based on the findings of this work, the following conclusions were drawn: non-traditional marriage is a relationship in which the number of participants, their gender, the method of marriage registration, as well as the method of choosing a partner differ from the generally accepted standard of “the man and the woman” to meet sexual interests and needs of the participants. It is noteworthy that family is the basis of the state, national identity, and cultural development. Without a family in its traditional sense, it is impossible to preserve traditions and to pass them on from one generation to another. Therefore, it is imperative for us and our legislators to seriously consider the legalization of the concept of non-traditional marriages so that they are prohibited and the individuals who are looking to enter into such marriages are persecuted, since these newfangled Western trends are aimed at the destruction of state values and the inexorable degradation of the state itself.",1

In psychology and pedagogy of Western countries, the problem of incentives to activity is revealed in a number of concepts and theories from different positions. Currently, motivation as a mental phenomenon is interpreted in different ways. The main theories of motivation should be divided into two directions: substantive theories, which consider motivation from structural positions, and procedural theories, which consider motivation as a dynamic formation. What unites these areas is the understanding of motivation as secondary to the motive of education. The concept of “willingness” for activity is considered as an active and effective state of the person, the installation to determine behavior, mobilization of forces to perform the task. In the structure of professional willingness of the individual, researchers identify different components, among which the most important is the motivational one –attitude to the profession, the need to solve successfully the task and interest in the activity.

The NDVI index identified the overall vegetation cover of the wetlands on and out of the coast. Then, dominant plants and representative of wetland status were identified and evaluated by unsupervised classification. The diversity of water birds and waders was assessed using Total Count Method. Species diversity index, species uniformity and interspecific similarity were calculated and reported.Results: The catchment area of the studied wetland has decreased significantly during the last 10 years and the type of vegetation and area of the catchment area has increased toward nutritional state. The highest number of migratory water birds belonged to the duckweed, with an average of 65.99% of the total migratory bird population belonged to this species, especially the water feeding ducks.Conclusion: Due to the lack of legal compliance with the wetland and the increasing use of agricultural and human-made land uses, this changing and growing land use will have adverse effects on the wetland ecosystem",1

The purpose is to find pedagogical conditions that contribute to the development of the cognitive independence of students in humanities while studying mathematics at a basic level. The authors provide a logical and didactic analysis of the existing basic-level mathematics textbooks and describe the features of the students in the humanitarian classes. The authors substantiate the pedagogical conditions required for the development of cognitive independence among these students: enrichment of the content of the humanitarian subject areas with an educational and methodological complex aimed at developing cognitive independence; the involvement of students in the humanitarian classes to develop an independent cognitive process under the condition of using the educational information environment. These conditions are said to activate mental activity, contributing to the development of cognitive independence in the study of mathematics.

The problem studied in this article is significant and modern. The comparative study of the syntax of different languages, such as Tatar and French, is extremely important, since it is syntax that is the most valuable source of information about the culture of a particular people, the ideas about morality, the relations to the surrounding world, etc., which becomes the property of linguistic consciousness. This is due to the need for a linguistic analysis of Tatar and French language expressive syntax, as well as to the insufficient study of expressiveness category operation at the syntactic level. Expressive verbal sentences of Tatar and French languages are specialized syntactic means and serve to implement the category of emotional expression. Verbal emotional-expressive sentences in Tatar and French are distinguished by a great variety of structural types.

Foreign direct investment (FDI) is an international capital movement created to create, develop or support a foreign subsidiary, as well as to exercise control over the management of a foreign enterprise. Foreign direct investment (FDI) is the driving element of multinationalization of companies, the creation of subsidiaries abroad or other financial relations. Reducing investment costs (exploitation of expensive natural resources, even impossible for transportation, using cheaper labor, optimizing taxation) and conquering new markets that are difficult to cover only through exports, are the main reasons for foreign direct investment. Foreign direct investment has risen sharply since the mid-1980s (more than 10.6%) and is one of the main factors contributing to the globalization of the economy. Thus, Gabon remains a potential foreign direct investment market due to the wealth and diversity of its economy. This diversity of the Gabonese economy groups all sectors of economic activity, such as transport, services, tourism, construction, telecommunications, oil and gas, and others.

Disposing of a model enabling to predict the impact points and the distance of striking down by lightning should permit to prevent the dangerous effects on engineering systems. Contrary to the positive lightning for which many theoretical models are available, researches to derive models for the negative lightning are still at their earlier stages, due to the complexity of the mechanisms involved in the negative lightning propagation process. This contribution is in the continuity of our previous work related to the positive long discharge in air gaps and positive lightning. A self-consistent dynamic model of negative lightning discharge taking into account the different phases of the propagation (i.e., the initiation of the first corona, the negative and space leaders and the junction of leaders) and return stroke is presented. This model uses LCR line electrical network parameters derived from electromagnetic field, physical laws and gas discharge theories. It enables to determine the main macroscopic parameters of the negative discharge (current and corresponding charge, propagation velocities, potential drop along its channel, power and energy injected into the gap and a trajectory of the discharge plotted in 3D in real time obtained from a probabilistic distribution) and the associated return stroke (current and charge, velocity ...). Different cloud xe2x80x93 ground distances are considered. The computed results are discussed with respects to the experimental data reported in the literature.",1

The structure has been introduced by Xin He under the name of regular edge-labelling and consists of two bipolar orientations that are transversal. For this reason, the terminology used here is that of transversal structures. The main results obtained in the article are a bijection between irreducible triangulations and ternary trees, and a straight-line drawing algorithm for irreducible triangulations. For a random irreducible triangulation with n vertices, the grid size of the drawing is asymptotically with high probability 11n/27 x 11n/27 up to an additive error of O(n). In contrast, the best previously known algorithm for these triangulations only guarantees a grid size ([n/2]-1) x [n/2].",1

Graphs admitting such representations are well understood (via simple characterizations) and recognizable in linear time. For a directed graph G, a bar visibility representation (psi ) of G, additionally, for each directed edge (u, v) of G, puts the bar (psi (u)) strictly below the bar (psi (v)). We study a generalization of the recognition problem where a function (psi ') defined on a subset (V') of V(G) is given and the question is whether there is a bar visibility representation (psi ) of G with (psi |V' = psi ').

The goal is a common permutation xcfx80* which minimizes the number of crossings. In voting and social science theory this is known as the Kemeny optimal aggregation problem minimizing the Kendall-r distance. This rank aggregation problem can be phrased as a one-sided two-layer crossing minimization problem for a series of bipartite graphs or for an edge coloured bipartite graph, where crossings are counted only for monochromatic edges. We contribute the max version of the crossing minimization problem, which attempts to minimize the discrimination against any permutation. As our results, we correct the construction from [C. Dwork, R. Kumar, M. Noar, D. Sivakumar, Rank aggregation methods for the Web, Proc. WWW10 (2001) 613-622] and prove the NP-hardness of the common crossing minimization problem for k = 4 permutations.

Both approximations are optimal, if the common permutation is selected from the given ones.

So far, only a few examples of basic force-directed algorithms that work in a distributed environment have been described. Instead, the design of a distributed multilevel force-directed algorithm is a much more challenging task, not yet addressed. We present the first multilevel force-directed algorithm based on a distributed vertex-centric paradigm, and its implementation on Giraph, a popular platform for distributed graph algorithms. Experiments show the effectiveness and the scalability of the approach. Using an inexpensive cloud computing service of Amazon, we draw graphs with ten million edges in about 60 min.",1

This causal topology is crucial to understand dynamical processes, assess the role of nodes, or detect clusters. However, we lack graph drawing techniques that incorporate this information into static visualisations. Addressing this gap, we present a novel dynamic graph visualisation algorithm that utilises higher-order graphical models of causal paths in time series data to compute time-aware static graph visualisations.

The network N is typically visualized by drawing T downward and planar and reticulation edges with one of several different styles. One aesthetic criteria is to minimize the number of crossings between tree edges and reticulation edges. This optimization problem has not yet been researched. We show that, if reticulation edges are drawn x-monotone, the problem is NP-complete, but fixed-parameter tractable in the number of reticulation edges.

The problem arises in graphs of high density or high conductance, and in the presence of high-degree vertices, all of which tend to pull vertices together and thus clutter variation in local density.n n We here propose a method to draw online social networks, a special class of hairball graphs. The method is based on a spanning subgraph that is sparse but connected and consists of strong ties holding together communities. To identify these ties we propose a novel measure of embeddedness. It is based on a weighted accumulation of triangles in quadrangles and can be determined efficiently. An evaluation on empirical and generated networks indicates that our approach improves upon previous methods using other edge indices. Although primarily designed to achieve more informative drawings, our spanning subgraph may also serve as a sparsifier that trims a hairball graph before the application of a clustering algorithm.",1

Recently, there has been an increased interest in the problem of minimizing crossings between paths in drawings of graphs. This is the metro-line crossing minimization problem MLCM: Given an embedded graph and a set L of simple paths, called lines, order the lines on each edge so that the total number of crossings is minimized. So far, the complexity of MLCM has been an open problem. In contrast, the problem variant in which line ends must be placed in outermost position on their edges MLCM-P is known to be NP-hard.n n Our main results answer two open questions: i We show that MLCM is NP-hard. ii We give an $Osqrt{log |L|}$ -approximation algorithm for MLCM-P.",1

Let the four line segments of a plus shape be its arms. In a c-balanced representation, c xe2x89xa4 1, every arm can touch at most (lceil cvarDeltan ceil) other arms, where (varDelta) is the maximum degree of G. The widely studied T- and L-contact representations are c-balanced representations, where c could be as large as 1. In contrast, the goal in a c-balanced representation is to minimize c. Let c k , where k xe2x88x88 {2,3}, be the smallest c such that every planar k-tree has a c-balanced representation. In this paper we show that 1/4 xe2x89xa4 c 2 xe2x89xa4 1/3 ( = b 2) and 1/3 < c 3 xe2x89xa4 1/2 ( = b 3). Our result has several consequences. Firstly, planar k-trees admit 1-bend box-orthogonal drawings with boxes of size (lceil b_kvarDeltan ceil times lceil b_kvarDeltan ceil), which generalizes a result of Tayu, Nomura, and Ueno. Secondly, they admit 1-bend polyline drawings with (2lceil b_kvarDeltan ceil) slopes, which is significantly smaller than the (2varDelta) upper bound established by Keszegh, Pach, and Palvolgyi for arbitrary planar graphs.",1

Thomas, Karsten Klein, Peter Eades, Seok-Hee Hong","Data sets of very large graphs are now commonplace; the scale of these graphs presents considerable difficulties for graph visualization methods. The use of interactive techniques and large screens have been proposed as two possible avenues to address these difficulties.This paper presents GION, a new skeletal animation technique for interacting with large graphs on wall-sized displays. Our technique is based on a physical simulation, and aims to enhance the users' ability to efficiently interact with the graph visualization for exploratory analysis. We conducted a user study to evaluate our technique against standard operations available in most graph layout editors, and the study shows that the new technique produces layouts with less stress, and fewer edge crossings. GION is preferred by users, and requires significantly less mouse movement.",1

This strategy can be applied to obtain graphs admitting UPCRs with squares and cubes, whose recognition is NP-complete.n n We show that subgraphs of the square grid allow for UPCR with squares which strengthens the previously known cube representation. Indeed, we give UPCR for subgraphs of a d-dimensional grid with d-cubes. Additionally, we show that subgraphs of the triangular grid admit a UPCR with cubes, implying that the same holds for each subgraph of an Archimedean grid. Considering further polygons, we construct UPCR with regular 3k-gons of the hexagonal grid and UPCR with regular 4k-gons of the square grid.",1

Brandenburg,"A graph is a cycle of cliques, if its set of vertices can be partitioned into clusters, such that each cluster is a clique and the cliques form a cycle. Then there is a partition of the set of edges into inner edges of the cliques and interconnection edges between the clusters. Cycles of cliques are a special instance of two-level clustered graphs. Such graphs are drawn by a two phase method: draw the top level graph and then browse into the clusters. In general, it is NP-hard whether or not a graph is a two-level clustered graph of a particular type, e.g. a clique or a planar graph or a triangle of cliques. However, it is efficiently solvable whether or not a graph is a path of cliques or is a large cycle of cliques.",1
